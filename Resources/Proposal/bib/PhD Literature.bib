abstract = {We present an extended analysis of our previous work on the HydroSense technology, which is a low-cost and easily installed single-point sensor of pressure for automatically disaggregating water usage activities in the home (Froehlich et al., 2009 [53]). We expand upon this work by providing a survey of existing and emerging water disaggregation techniques, a more comprehensive description of the theory of operation behind our approach, and an expanded analysis section that includes hot versus cold water valve usage classification and a comparison between two classification approaches: the template-based matching scheme used in Froehlich et al. (2009) [53] and a new stochastic approach using a Hidden Markov Model. We show that both are successful in identifying valve- and fixture-level water events with greater than 90{\%} accuracies. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations in our experimental methodology and open problems going forward. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the analysis of the aggregate power consumption of electric loads in order to recognize the existence and the consumption profile of each individual appliance. In this paper, we briefly describe our ongoing research on an unsupervised NILM system suitable for applications in the residential sector. The proposed system consists of the typical stages of an event-based NILM system with the difference that only unsupervised algorithms are utilized in each stage eliminating the need for a pre-training process and providing wider applicability. In the event detector, a grid-based clustering algorithm is utilized in order to segment the power signals into transient and steady-state sections. Macroscopic features are extracted from the detected events and used in a mean-shift clustering algorithm. The system is tested on the publicly available BLUED dataset and shows event detection and clustering accuracy more than 98{\%}. The system also shows possible disaggregation up to 92{\%} of the energy of phase A of the BLUED dataset. Moreover, the system has been utilized in an energy-disaggregation competition held by Belkin and achieved a score within the top ten results with disaggregation of more than 93{\%} of the total time.},

@article{Murtagh2014,
abstract = {The introduction of electricity monitors (in-home displays; IHDs), which show accurate and up-to-the-minute energy usage, is expected to lead to reduction in consumption. Studies of feedback on domestic electricity use have generally supported this view. However, such studies also demonstrate wide variation between households. Examining the heterogeneity of responses is essential for understanding the actual and potential effectiveness of IHDs and in order to target interventions effectively. To explore differences between households' responses to IHDs, we conducted a qualitative study with 21 households who had an IHD for more than six months. Of the 21, only four households continued to refer to the IHD and the findings suggest that attempts to reduce energy consumption were situated in wider social and physical contexts. Further, the participants demonstrated energy saving behaviour before and outside of IHD usage. The patterns of energy behaviours and attempts at electricity conservation could best be understood by categorising the households into three types: the Monitor Enthusiasts (20{\%}), the Aspiring Energy Savers (60{\%}) and the Energy Non-Engaged (20{\%}). The factors of importance in energy behaviour differed between the categories. Financial savings contributed to efforts to reduce energy use but only up to boundaries which varied considerably between households. Social practices and social relationships appeared to constrain what actions households were prepared to undertake, illuminating aspects of inter-household variation. Within the household, all energy users were not equal and we found that women were particularly influential on energy use through their primary responsibility for domestic labour on behalf of the household. The implications of the findings for environmental campaigning are discussed.},

Several particularly promising applications involve the disaggregation of individual appliances within a particular household in terms of their energy demand. In this paper we present an infrastructure and a set of algorithms that make use of smart meters together with smartphones to realize new energy efficiency services (such as itemized electricity bills or targeted energy saving advice). The smartphones, together with a novel filtering approach, much simplify the training process for appliances signature recognition. We also report on the performance of our system that was tested with 8 simultaneous devices, achieving recognition rates of 87{\%}.},

abstract = {Many countries are rolling out smart electricity meters. These measure a home's total power demand. However, research into consumer behaviour suggests that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the 'ground truth' demand of individual appliances. In this context, we present UK-DALE: an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from five houses, one of which was recorded for 655 days, the longest duration we are aware of for any energy dataset at this sample rate. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring, or energy disaggregation, aims to separate household energy consumption data collected from a single point of measurement into appliance-level consumption data. In recent years, the field has rapidly expanded due to increased interest as national deployments of smart meters have begun in many countries. However, empirically comparing disaggregation algorithms is currently virtually impossible. This is due to the different data sets used, the lack of reference implementations of these algorithms and the variety of accuracy metrics employed. To address this challenge, we present the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK); an open source toolkit designed specifically to enable the comparison of energy disaggregation algorithms in a reproducible manner. This work is the first research to compare multiple disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets. Our toolkit includes parsers for a range of existing data sets, a collection of preprocessing algorithms, a set of statistics for describing data sets, two reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms and a suite of accuracy metrics. We demonstrate the range of reproducible analyses which are made possible by our toolkit, including the analysis of six publicly available data sets and the evaluation of both benchmark disaggregation algorithms across such data sets.},

abstract = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technology offering methods to identify appliances in homes based on their consumption characteristics and the total household demand. Recently, many different novel NILM approaches were introduced, tested on real-world data and evaluated with a common evaluation metric. However, the fair comparison between different NILM approaches even with the usage of the same evaluation metric is nearly impossible due to incomplete or missing problem definitions. Each NILM approach typically is evaluated under different test scenarios. Test results are thus influenced by the considered appliances, the number of used appliances, the device type representing the appliance and the pre-processing stages denoising the consumption data. This paper introduces a novel complexity measure of aggregated consumption data providing an assessment of the problem complexity affected by the used appliances, the appliance characteristics and the appliance usage over time. We test our load disaggregation complexity on different real-world datasets and with a state-of-the-art NILM approach. The introduced disaggregation complexity measure is able to classify the disaggregation problem based on the used appliance set and the considered measurement noise.},

abstract = {Smart meter deployments are spurring renewed interest in analysis techniques for electricity usage data. An important prerequisite for data analysis is characterizing and modeling how electrical loads use power. While prior work has made significant progress in deriving insights from electricity data, one issue that limits accuracy is the use of general and often simplistic load models. Prior models often associate a fixed power level with an “on” state and either no power, or some minimal amount, with an “off” state. This paper's goal is to develop a new methodology for modeling electric loads that is both simple and accurate. Our approach is empirical in nature: we monitor a wide variety of common loads to distill a small number of common usage characteristics, which we leverage to construct accurate load-specific models. We show that our models are significantly more accurate than binary on-off models, decreasing the root mean square error by as much as 8X for representative loads. Finally, we demonstrate two example uses of our models in data analysis: i) generating device-accurate synthetic traces of building electricity usage, and ii) filtering out loads that generate rapid and random power variations in building electricity data},

abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation, aims to disaggregate a household's electricity consumption into constituent appliances. More than three decades of work in NILM has resulted in the development of several novel algorithmic approaches. However, despite these advancements, two core challenges still exist: i) disaggregating low power consumption appliances and ii) distinguishing between multiple instances of similar appliances. These challenges are becoming increasingly important due to an increasing number of appliances and increased usage of electronics in homes. Previous approaches have attempted to solve these problems using expensive hardware involving high sampling rates better suited to laboratory settings, or using additional number of sensors, limiting the ease of deployment. In this work, we explore using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) power line communication (PLC) modems as an inexpensive and easy to deploy alternative solution to these problems. We use the reduction in bandwidth between two PLC modems, caused due to the change in PLC modulation scheme when different appliances are operated as a signature for an appliance. Since the noise generated in the powerline is dependent both on type and location of an appliance, we believe that our technique based on PLC modems can be a promising addition for solving NILM.},

abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources increases the complexity in mantaining the power grid. In particular, the highly dynamic nature of generation and consumption demands for a better utilization of energy resources, which seen the cost of storage infrastructure, can only be achieved through demand-response. Accordingly, the availability of energy and potential overload situations can be reflected using a price signal. The effectiveness of this mechanism arises from the flexibility of device operation, which is nevertheless heavily reliant on the exchange of information between the grid and its consumers. In this paper, we investigate the capability of an interactive energy management system to timely inform users on energy usage, in order to promote an optimal use of local resources. In particular, we analyze data being collected in several households in Italy and Austria to gain insights into usage behavior and drive the design of more effective systems. The outcome is the formulation of energy efficiency policies for residential buildings, as well as the design of an energy management system, consisting of hardware measurement units and a management software. The Mj$\backslash$"olnir framework, which we release for open use, provides a platform where various feedback concepts can be implemented and assessed. This includes widgets displaying disaggregated and aggregated consumption information, as well as daily production and tailored advices. The formulated policies were implemented as an advisor widget able to autonomously analyze usage and provide tailored energy feedback.},

abstract = {Energy disaggregation is the process of estimating the energy consumed by individual electrical appliances given only a time series of the whole-home power demand. Energy disaggregation researchers require datasets of the power demand from individual appliances and the whole-home power demand. Multiple such datasets have been released over the last few years but provide metadata in a disparate array of formats including CSV files and plain-text README files. At best, the lack of a standard metadata schema makes it unnecessarily time-consuming to write software to process multiple datasets and, at worse, the lack of a standard means that crucial information is simply absent from some datasets. We propose a metadata schema for representing appliances, meters, buildings, datasets, prior knowledge about appliances and appliance models. The schema is relational and provides a simple but powerful inheritance mechanism.},

abstract = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technique that determines the electrical load composition of a household through a single point of measurement at the main power feed. In contrast with the majority of the existing approaches to solve this problem which require training, here we explore an unsupervised approach to determine the number of appliances in the household, their power consumption and state, at any given moment. We attempt to achieve this without using any a priori information on the number and type of appliances. Our approach is to first create clusters of steady-state changes and then employ a matching pursuit algorithm to reconstruct the original power signals using the clusters that were found as the sources in a linear blind source separation strategy. Changes in steady-state, sometimes referred to as events, are characterized by their change in real and reactive power (P and Q). Ultimately, the results may be applied to other features in an attempt to improve the separation between clusters. The preliminary results point toward a mixed scenario: large appliances (roughly above 400W) were easily identified, but the small appliances typically clustered together and were difficult to separate. We conclude that the errors occur during clustering which indicates that, in order to increase the purity of the clusters, perhaps other features could be used.},

abstract = {Utilities are currently deploying smart electricity meters in millions of households worldwide to collect fine-grained electricity consumption data. We present an approach to automatically analyzing this data to enable personalized and scalable energy efficiency programs for private households. In particular, we develop and evaluate a system that uses supervised machine learning techniques to automatically estimate specific “characteristics” of a household from its electricity consumption. The characteristics are related to a household's socio-economic status, its dwelling, or its appliance stock. We evaluate our approach by analyzing smart meter data collected from 4232 households in Ireland at a 30-min granularity over a period of 1.5 years. Our analysis shows that revealing characteristics from smart meter data is feasible, as our method achieves an accuracy of more than 70{\%} over all households for many of the characteristics and even exceeds 80{\%} for some of the characteristics. The findings are applicable to all smart metering systems without making changes to the measurement infrastructure. The inferred knowledge paves the way for targeted energy efficiency programs and other services that benefit from improved customer insights. On the basis of these promising results, the paper discusses the potential for utilities as well as policy and privacy implications.},

abstract = {Access to the nacelle of wind turbine generators to assess machinery running condition is a significant and universal problem. In the United States, modern condition based maintenance (CBM) data acquisition and communications hardware may not even be allowed to be installed in the nacelle, depending on warranty and other business arrangements between the owner, operator, and wind turbine manufacturer. As wind turbine warranties end, the problem of economically monitoring machinery health and maintaining turbine availability falls to the owner/operator. Work accomplished under this NYSERDA project has, based on site and lab tests, established the feasibility of using non-intrusive advanced vibration-based diagnostic/prognostic methodology. The innovation is that all measurements are taken at the base of the tower – access to the nacelle or sensors mounted on the gearbox and generator are not required. As related herein, a portable, easy-to-use data acquisition and processing system has been established and a prototype has been used to acquire and effectively process lab and field data. Initial use by and feedback from potential users has been positive. Implementing his technology can effectively increase the availability of wind turbines, reduce greenhouse gases, and use/advance the technology and industrial base in New York State.},

abstract = {Many countries are rolling out smart electricity meters. These measure a home's total power demand. However, research into consumer behaviour suggests that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the `ground truth' demand of individual appliances. We present `UK-DALE': an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from four homes, one of which was recorded for 499 days, the longest duration we are aware of for similar datasets. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.},

However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi- Markovianity, which has been developed in the parametric setting to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicitduration HDP-HSMM and develop posterior sampling algorithms for efficient inference in both the direct-assignment and weak-limit approximation settings. We demonstrate the utility of the model and our inference methods on synthetic data as well as experiments on a speaker diarization problem and an example of learning the patterns in Morse code.},

abstract = {Increase in the rate of appliance ownership1 with rising incomes is a major driver of the growth of residential electricity consumption in developing countries. Macroeconomic parameters such as GDP growth, while useful in forecasting residential electricity use, may fail to take into account the determinants of appliance use at the household level, such as total market penetration of primary appliances among certain classes, subsequent ordering and climate dependency of secondary products, the dynamics of economic growth and income distribution, urbanization and rural electrification. A detailed, multi-country investigation of the relationship between household income and appliance ownership is therefore valuable for predicting future residential energy consumption, as well as evaluating strategies for mitigation of its environmental impacts. This paper describes an analysis of recent survey data from six countries (Brazil, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and South Africa) yielding data on income and appliance ownership for a large sample of households. We use an econometric parameterisation to model the relationship between income and ownership for each country, and for each appliance for which data are available. This model accounts for economic variability in households in different countries due to variation in development of local markets, and makes a determination of the order of successive appliance purchases and corresponding income levels. In addition, the paper presents the results of using non- economic parameters (such as climate, degree of urbanization and electrification rate) as a means of explaining variability between countries. Finally, we evaluate the use of the household-level model along with macroeconomic and other parameters in order to predict national ownership rates.},

abstract = {Non intrusive load monitoring (NILM), or energy disaggregation, is the process of separating the total electricity consumption of a building as measured at single point into the building's constituent loads. Previous research in the field has mostly focused on residential buildings, and although the potential benefits of applying this technology to commercial buildings have been recognised since the field's conception, NILM in the commercial domain has been largely unexplored by the academic community. As a result of the heterogeneity of this section of the building stock (i.e., encompassing buildings as diverse as airports, malls and coffee shops), and hence the loads within them, many of the solutions developed for residential energy disaggregation do not apply directly. In this paper we highlight some insights for NILM in the commercial domain using data collected from a large smart meter deployment within an educational campus in Delhi, India, of which a subset of the data has been released for public use. We present an empirical characterisation of loads in commercial buildings, highlighting the differences in energy consumption and load characteristics between residential and commercial buildings. We assess the validity of the assumptions generally made by NILM solutions for residential buildings when applied to measurements from commercial facilities. Based on our observations, we discuss the required traits for a NILM system for commercial buildings, and run benchmark residential NILM algorithms on our data set to confirm our observations. To advance the research in commercial buildings energy disaggregation, we release a subset of our data set, called COMBED (commercial building energy data set).},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the extent to which the use of in-home displays affects daily practices and electricity consumption. Through two pilot projects, in-home displays were installed in 33 Norwegian homes, and we provide a qualitative analysis of the effects. The results point to the potential differences in the ways households interact with the in-home displays. The effects differed among various groups according to people's previous experiences with monitoring and their level of affluence. In the sample, affluent respondents living in detached houses tended to be accustomed to monitoring consumption before the display was introduced. These families used the display for controlling that “nothing was wrong”, but they did not use the information provided by the display to initiate new energy saving measures. In contrast, among less affluent flat owners the notion of “control” was specifically linked to the family's management of finances, and in this sense the displays empowered them. In addition, the results indicate that the in-home display for this group resulted in electricity savings. The study adds to earlier research on the effects of in-home displays by showing the importance of previous experience with monitoring electricity for the effects of feedback and by highlighting not only energy savings but also social effects of displays.},

@inproceedings{Kolter2012,
abstract = {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states. Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima. In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a "robust" mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time. Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice. The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.},

abstract = {A home-based intelligent energy conservation system needs to know what appliances (or loads) are being used in the home and when they are being used in order to provide intelligent feedback or to make intelligent decisions. This analysis task is known as load disaggregation or non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). The datasets used for NILM research generally contain real power readings, with the data often being too coarse for more sophisticated analysis algorithms, and often covering too short a time period. We present the Almanac of Minutely Power dataset (AMPds) for load disaggregation research; it contains one year of data that includes 11 measurements at one minute intervals for 21 sub-meters. AMPds also includes natural gas and water consumption data. Finally, we use AMPds to present findings from our own load disaggregation algorithm to show that current, rather than real power, is a more effective measure for NILM.},

abstract = {Energy disaggregation, also known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), is the task of separating aggregate energy data for a whole building into the energy data for individual appliances. Studies have shown that simply providing disaggregated data to the consumer improves energy consumption behavior. However, placing individual sensors on every device in a home is not presently a practical solution. Disaggregation provides a feasible method for providing energy usage behavior data to the consumer which utilizes currently existing infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel framework to perform the energy disaggregation task. We model each individual device as a single-input, single-output system, where the output is the power consumed by the device and the input is the device usage. In this framework, the task of disaggregation translates into finding inputs for each device that generates our observed power consumption. We describe an implementation of this framework, and show its results on simulated data as well as data from a small-scale experiment.},

@article{Batra2014e,
abstract = {Buildings across the world contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption and are thus stakeholders in grid operations. Towards the development of a smart grid, utilities and governments across the world are encouraging smart meter deployments. High resolution (often at every 15 minutes) data from these smart meters can be used to understand and optimize energy consumptions in buildings. In addition to smart meters, buildings are also increasingly managed with Building Management Systems (BMS) which control different sub-systems such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). With the advent of these smart meters, increased usage of BMS and easy availability and widespread installation of ambient sensors, there is a deluge of building energy data. This data has been leveraged for a variety of applications such as demand response, appliance fault detection and optimizing HVAC schedules. Beyond the traditional use of such data sets, they can be put to effective use towards making buildings smarter and hence driving every possible bit of energy efficiency. Effective use of this data entails several critical areas from sensing to decision making and participatory involvement of occupants. Picking from wide literature in building energy efficiency, we identify five crust areas (also referred to as 5 Is) for realizing data driven energy efficiency in buildings : i) instrument optimally; ii) interconnect sub-systems; iii) inferred decision making; iv) involve occupants and v) intelligent operations. We classify prior work as per these 5 Is and dis-cuss challenges, opportunities and applications across them. Building upon these 5 Is we discuss a well studied problem in building energy efficiency -non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and how research in this area spans across the 5 Is.},
