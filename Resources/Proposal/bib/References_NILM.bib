abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring, or energy disaggregation, aims to separate household energy consumption data collected from a single point of measurement into appliance-level consumption data. In recent years, the field has rapidly expanded due to increased interest as national deployments of smart meters have begun in many countries. However, empirically comparing disaggregation algorithms is currently virtually impossible. This is due to the different data sets used, the lack of reference implementations of these algorithms and the variety of accuracy metrics employed. To address this challenge, we present the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK); an open source toolkit designed specifically to enable the comparison of energy disaggregation algorithms in a reproducible manner. This work is the first research to compare multiple disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets. Our toolkit includes parsers for a range of existing data sets, a collection of preprocessing algorithms, a set of statistics for describing data sets, two reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms and a suite of accuracy metrics. We demonstrate the range of reproducible analyses which are made possible by our toolkit, including the analysis of six publicly available data sets and the evaluation of both benchmark disaggregation algorithms across such data sets.},

abstract = {We present the architecture, design, and preliminary evaluation of ACme, a wireless sensor and actuator network for monitoring AC energy usage and controlling AC devices in a large and diverse building environment. The ACme system consists of three tiers: the ACme node which provides a metering and control interface to a single outlet, a network fabric which allows this interface to be exported to arbitrary IP endpoints, and application software that uses this networked interface to provide various power-centric applications. The ACme node integrates an Epic core module with a dedicated energy metering IC to provide real, reactive, and apparent power measurements, with optional control of an attached load. The network comprises a complete IPv6/6LoWPAN stack on every node and an edge router that connects to other IP networks. The application tier receives and stores readings in a database and uses a Web server for visualization. Nodes automatically join the IPv6 subnet after being plugged in, and begin interactions with the application layer. We evaluate our system in a preliminary green building deployment with 49 nodes spread over several floors of a Computer Science Building and present energy consumption data from this preliminary deployment.},

abstract = {Appliance Load Monitoring (ALM) is essential for energy management solutions, allowing them to obtain appliance-specific energy consumption statistics that can further be used to devise load scheduling strategies for optimal energy utilization. Fine-grained energy monitoring can be achieved by deploying smart power outlets on every device of interest; however it incurs extra hardware cost and installation complexity. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an attractive method for energy disaggregation, as it can discern devices from the aggregated data acquired from a single point of measurement. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of NILM system and its associated methods and techniques used for disaggregated energy sensing. We review the state-of-the art load signatures and disaggregation algorithms used for appliance recognition and highlight challenges and future research directions.},

@article{Batra2014b,
abstract = {Non intrusive load monitoring (NILM), or energy disaggregation, is the process of separating the total electricity consumption of a building as measured at single point into the building's constituent loads. Previous research in the field has mostly focused on residential buildings, and although the potential benefits of applying this technology to commercial buildings have been recognised since the field's conception, NILM in the commercial domain has been largely unexplored by the academic community. As a result of the heterogeneity of this section of the building stock (i.e., encompassing buildings as diverse as airports, malls and coffee shops), and hence the loads within them, many of the solutions developed for residential energy disaggregation do not apply directly. In this paper we highlight some insights for NILM in the commercial domain using data collected from a large smart meter deployment within an educational campus in Delhi, India, of which a subset of the data has been released for public use. We present an empirical characterisation of loads in commercial buildings, highlighting the differences in energy consumption and load characteristics between residential and commercial buildings. We assess the validity of the assumptions generally made by NILM solutions for residential buildings when applied to measurements from commercial facilities. Based on our observations, we discuss the required traits for a NILM system for commercial buildings, and run benchmark residential NILM algorithms on our data set to confirm our observations. To advance the research in commercial buildings energy disaggregation, we release a subset of our data set, called COMBED (commercial building energy data set).},

Assessing the suitability of NILM algorithms to be used in real scenarios is however still cumbersome, mainly because there exists no standardized evaluation procedure for NILM algorithms and the availability of comprehensive electricity consumption data sets on which to run such a procedure is still limited. This paper contributes to the solution of this problem by: (1) outlining the key dimensions of the design space of NILM algorithms; (2) presenting a novel, comprehensive data set to evaluate the performance of NILM algorithms; (3) describing the design and implementation of a framework that significantly eases the evaluation of NILM algorithms using different data sets and parameter configurations; (4) demonstrating the use of the presented framework and data set through an extensive performance evaluation of four selected NILM algorithms. Both the presented data set and the evaluation framework are made publicly available.},

@article{Batra2015,
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate whether "big-data" is more valuable than "precise" data for the problem of energy disaggregation: the process of breaking down aggregate energy usage on a per-appliance basis. Existing techniques for disaggregation rely on energy metering at a resolution of 1 minute or higher, but most power meters today only provide a reading once per month, and at most once every 15 minutes. In this paper, we propose a new technique called Neighbourhood NILM that leverages data from 'neighbouring' homes to disaggregate energy given only a single energy reading per month. The key intuition behind our approach is that 'similar' homes have 'similar' energy consumption on a per-appliance basis. Neighbourhood NILM matches every home with a set of 'neighbours' that have direct submetering infrastructure, i.e. power meters on individual circuits or loads. Many such homes already exist. Then, it estimates the appliance-level energy consumption of the target home to be the average of its K neighbours. We evaluate this approach using 25 homes and results show that our approach gives comparable or better disaggregation in comparison to state-of-the-art accuracy reported in the literature that depend on manual model training, high frequency power metering, or both. Results show that Neighbourhood NILM can achieve 83{\%} and 79{\%} accuracy disaggregating fridge and heating/cooling loads, compared to 74{\%} and 73{\%} for a technique called FHMM. Furthermore, it achieves up to 64{\%} accuracy on washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, and lighting loads, which is higher than previously reported results. Many existing techniques are not able to disaggregate these loads at all. These results indicate a potentially substantial advantage to installing submetering infrastructure in a select few homes rather than installing new high-frequency smart metering infrastructure in all homes.},

Each input's latent representation is predicted conditional on the observed data using a feature-rich conditional random field (CRF). Then a reconstruction of the input is (re)generated, conditional on the latent structure, using a generative model which factorizes similarly to the CRF. The autoencoder formulation enables efficient exact inference without resorting to unrealistic independence assumptions or restricting the kinds of features that can be used. We illustrate connections to traditional autoencoders, posterior regularization, and multi-view learning. We then show competitive results with instantiations of the framework for two canonical tasks in natural language processing: part-of-speech induction and bitext word alignment, and show that training the proposed model can be substantially more efficient than a comparable feature-rich baseline.},

abstract = {Energy disaggregation (a.k.a nonintrusive load monitoring, NILM), a single-channel blind source separation problem, aims to decompose the mains which records the whole electricity consumption into appliance-wise readings. This problem is difficult because it is inherently unidentifiable. Recent approaches have shown that the identifiability problem could be reduced by introducing domain knowledge into the model. Deep neural networks have been shown to be promising to tackle this problem in literatures. However, it is not clear why and how the neural networks could work for this problem. In this paper, we propose sequence-to-point learning for NILM, where the input is a window of the mains and the output is a single point of the target appliance. We use convolutional neural networks to train the model. Interestingly, we systematically show that the convolutional neural networks can inherently learn the signatures of the target appliances, which are automatically added into the model to reduce the identifiability problem. We applied the proposed neural network approaches to a real-world household energy data, and show that the methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract = {In many statistical problems, a more coarse-grained model may be suitable for population-level behaviour, whereas a more detailed model is appropriate for accurate modelling of individual behaviour. This raises the question of how to integrate both types of models. Methods such as posterior regularization follow the idea of generalized moment matching, in that they allow matching expectations between two models, but sometimes both models are most conveniently expressed as latent variable models. We propose latent Bayesian melding, which is motivated by averaging the distributions over populations statistics of both the individual-level and the population-level models under a logarithmic opinion pool framework. In a case study on electricity disaggregation, which is a type of single-channel blind source separation problem, we show that latent Bayesian melding leads to significantly more accurate predictions than an approach based solely on generalized moment matching.},

abstract = {This work presents a new approach to learning a framebased classifier on weakly labelled sequence data by embedding a CNN within an iterative EM algorithm. This allows the CNN to be trained on a vast number of example images when only loose sequence level information is available for the source videos. Although we demonstrate this in the context of hand shape recognition, the approach has wider application to any video recognition task where frame level labelling is not available. The iterative EM algorithm leverages the discriminative ability of the CNN to iteratively refine the frame level annotation and subsequent training of the CNN. By embedding the classifier within an EM framework the CNN can easily be trained on 1 million hand images. We demonstrate that the final classifier generalises over both individuals and data sets. The algorithm is evaluated on over 3000 manually labelled hand shape images of 60 different classes which will be released to the community. Furthermore, we demonstrate its use in continuous sign language recognition on two publicly available large sign language data sets, where it outperforms the current stateoftheart by a large margin. To our knowledge no previous work has explored expectation maximization without Gaussian mixture models to exploit weak sequence labels for sign language recognition.},

This study proposes a robust fault detection method with an Artificial Neural Network-Multi-Layer Perceptron (ANN-MLP) and a statistical module based on Wald's sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). To detect a fault, this method uses the mean and the standard deviation of the residual noise obtained from applying a NARX (Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous input) model. To develop the neural network model, the required training and testing data were generated at different operating conditions. To show the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection method, it was tested on a realistic fault of a distillation plant at the laboratory scale.},

abstract = {—An increasing interest in energy-efficiency com-bined with the decreasing cost of embedded networked sensors is lowering the cost of outlet-level metering. If these trends continue, new buildings in the near future will be able to install " smart " outlets, which monitor and transmit an outlets power usage in real time, for nearly the same cost as conventional outlets. One problem with the pervasive deployment of smart outlets is that users must currently identify the specific device plugged into each meter, and then manually update the outlets meta-data in software whenever a new device is plugged into the outlet. Correct meta-data is important in both interpreting historical outlet energy data and using the data for building management. To address this problem, we propose Non-Intrusive Load Identification (NILI), which automatically identifies the device attached to a smart outlet without any human intervention. In particular, in our approach to NILI, we identify an intuitive and simple-to-compute set of features from time-series energy data and then employ well-known classifiers. Our results achieve accuracy of over 90{\%} across 15 device types on outlet-level energy traces collected from multiple real homes.},

We interpret such datasets as signals on graphs, introduce the concept of graph filters for processing such signals, and discuss important properties of graph filters, including linearity, shift-invariance, and invertibility. We then demonstrate the application of graph filters to data classification by demonstrating that a classifier can be interpreted as an adaptive graph filter.

abstract = {Traditional whole building energy modeling suffers from several factors, including the large number of inputs required for building characterization, simplifying assumptions, and the gap between the as-designed and as-built building. Prior work has attempted to mitigate these problems by using sensor-based machine learning approaches to statistically model energy consumption, applying the techniques primarily to commercial building data, which makes use of hourly consumption data. It is unclear, however, whether these techniques can translate to residential buildings, since the energy usage patterns may vary significantly. Until now, most residential modeling research only had access to monthly electrical consumption data. In this article, we report on the evaluation of seven different machine learning algorithms applied to a new residential data set that contains sensor measurements collected every 15 min, with the objective of determining which techniques are most successful for predicting next hour residential building consumption. We first validate each learner's correctness on the ASHRAE Great Energy Prediction Shootout, confirming existing conclusions that Neural Network-based methods perform best on commercial buildings. However, our additional results show that these methods perform poorly on residential data, and that Least Squares Support Vector Machines perform best - a technique not previously applied to this domain. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Murtagh2014,
abstract = {The introduction of electricity monitors (in-home displays; IHDs), which show accurate and up-to-the-minute energy usage, is expected to lead to reduction in consumption. Studies of feedback on domestic electricity use have generally supported this view. However, such studies also demonstrate wide variation between households. Examining the heterogeneity of responses is essential for understanding the actual and potential effectiveness of IHDs and in order to target interventions effectively. To explore differences between households' responses to IHDs, we conducted a qualitative study with 21 households who had an IHD for more than six months. Of the 21, only four households continued to refer to the IHD and the findings suggest that attempts to reduce energy consumption were situated in wider social and physical contexts. Further, the participants demonstrated energy saving behaviour before and outside of IHD usage. The patterns of energy behaviours and attempts at electricity conservation could best be understood by categorising the households into three types: the Monitor Enthusiasts (20{\%}), the Aspiring Energy Savers (60{\%}) and the Energy Non-Engaged (20{\%}). The factors of importance in energy behaviour differed between the categories. Financial savings contributed to efforts to reduce energy use but only up to boundaries which varied considerably between households. Social practices and social relationships appeared to constrain what actions households were prepared to undertake, illuminating aspects of inter-household variation. Within the household, all energy users were not equal and we found that women were particularly influential on energy use through their primary responsibility for domestic labour on behalf of the household. The implications of the findings for environmental campaigning are discussed.},

abstract = {We examine 12 studies on the efficacy of disaggregated energy feedback. The average electricity reduction across these studies is 4.5{\%}. However, 4.5{\%} may be a positively-biased estimate of the savings achievable across the entire population because all 12 studies are likely to be prone to opt-in bias hence none test the effect of disaggregated feedback on the general population. Disaggregation may not be required to achieve these savings: Aggregate feedback alone drives 3{\%} reductions; and the 4 studies which directly compared aggregate feedback against disaggregated feedback found that aggregate feedback is at least as effective as disaggregated feedback, possibly because web apps are viewed less often than in-home-displays (in the short-term, at least) and because some users do not trust fine-grained disaggregation (although this may be an issue with the specific user interface studied). Disaggregated electricity feedback may help a motivated sub-group of the population to save more energy but fine-grained disaggregation may not be necessary to achieve these energy savings. Disaggregation has many uses beyond those discussed in this paper but, on the specific question of promoting energy reduction in the general population, there is no robust evidence that current forms of disaggregated energy feedback are more effective than aggregate energy feedback. The effectiveness of disaggregated feedback may increase if the general population become more energy-conscious (e.g. if energy prices rise or concern about climate change deepens); or if users' trust in fine-grained disaggregation improves; or if innovative new approaches or alternative disaggregation strategies (e.g. disaggregating by behaviour rather than by appliance) out-perform existing feedback. We also discuss opportunities for new research into the effectiveness of disaggregated feedback.},

@techreport{Deng2013,
abstract = {This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the application areas that have already been transformed by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated research efforts, including natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered by multi-task deep learning. In Chapter 1, we provide the background of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature, deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular, selected chronological development of speech recognition is used to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition. In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods, one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques. Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category, which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative, unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the three-way categorization scheme. In Chapters 7-11, we select a set of typical and successful applications of deep learning in diverse areas of signal and information processing and of applied artificial intelligence. In Chapter 7, we review the applications of deep learning to speech and audio processing, with emphasis on speech recognition organized according to several prominent themes. In Chapters 8, we present recent results of applying deep learning to language modeling and natural language processing. Chapter 9 is devoted to selected applications of deep learning to information retrieval including Web search. In Chapter 10, we cover selected applications of deep learning to image object recognition in computer vision. Selected applications of deep learning to multi-modal processing and multi-task learning are reviewed in Chapter 11. Finally, an epilogue is given in Chapter 12 to summarize what we presented in earlier chapters and to discuss future challenges and directions.},

NILM is usually applied to identify the major loads in buildings, which is very promising in meeting the load monitoring requirements of demand response. Unlike the traditional approach of NILM in energy auditing, a new NILM system for DR is established based on a comprehensive analysis on the requirement of demand response. The new system is designed from both hardware and software aspects with a more practical load space and a more explicit measuring criteria. The ultimate goal of this paper is to pave the road for the future researchers to work in NILM for demand response.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency in smart buildings requires distributed sensing infrastructure to monitor the power consumption of appliances, machines and lighting sources. The analysis of current and voltage waveforms is fundamental for gathering diagnostic information about the power quality and for reducing power wastage. Moreover, it enables Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), which is the process of disaggregating a household's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances, by analysing the voltage and current changes. In this paper, an innovative full Energy-neutral (i.e. battery free) and Non-intrusive Wireless Energy Meter (NIWEM) is presented to measure current, voltage and power factor. As key features, the NIWEM is completely non-invasive and it can self-sustain its operations by harvesting energy from the monitored load. It also features a standard (Zigbee) wireless interface for communication with the smart-building system. Experimental results have confirmed that complete energy sustainability can be achieved also with very low-power loads.},

abstract = {Increase in the rate of appliance ownership1 with rising incomes is a major driver of the growth of residential electricity consumption in developing countries. Macroeconomic parameters such as GDP growth, while useful in forecasting residential electricity use, may fail to take into account the determinants of appliance use at the household level, such as total market penetration of primary appliances among certain classes, subsequent ordering and climate dependency of secondary products, the dynamics of economic growth and income distribution, urbanization and rural electrification. A detailed, multi-country investigation of the relationship between household income and appliance ownership is therefore valuable for predicting future residential energy consumption, as well as evaluating strategies for mitigation of its environmental impacts. This paper describes an analysis of recent survey data from six countries (Brazil, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and South Africa) yielding data on income and appliance ownership for a large sample of households. We use an econometric parameterisation to model the relationship between income and ownership for each country, and for each appliance for which data are available. This model accounts for economic variability in households in different countries due to variation in development of local markets, and makes a determination of the order of successive appliance purchases and corresponding income levels. In addition, the paper presents the results of using non- economic parameters (such as climate, degree of urbanization and electrification rate) as a means of explaining variability between countries. Finally, we evaluate the use of the household-level model along with macroeconomic and other parameters in order to predict national ownership rates.},

In this work, we explore a question that is highly pertinent to this research community: how good does energy disaggregation need to be in order to infer characteristics of a household? We present novel techniques that use unsupervised energy disaggregation to predict both household occupancy and static properties of the household such as size of the home and number of occupants. Results show that basic disaggregation approaches performs up to 30{\%} better at occupancy estimation than using aggregate power data alone, and are up to 10{\%} better at estimating static household characteristics. These results show that even rudimentary energy disaggregation techniques are sufficient for improved inference of household characteristics. To conclude, we re-evaluate the bar set by the community for energy disaggregation accuracy and try to answer the question "how good is good enough?"},

abstract = {—While perception tasks such as visual object recognition and text understanding play an important role in human intelligence, the subsequent tasks that involve inference, reasoning and planning require an even higher level of intelligence. The past few years have seen major advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a general introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this survey, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics like Bayesian treatment of neural networks.},

abstract = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technique that determines the electrical load composition of a household through a single point of measurement at the main power feed. In contrast with the majority of the existing approaches to solve this problem which require training, here we explore an unsupervised approach to determine the number of appliances in the household, their power consumption and state, at any given moment. We attempt to achieve this without using any a priori information on the number and type of appliances. Our approach is to first create clusters of steady-state changes and then employ a matching pursuit algorithm to reconstruct the original power signals using the clusters that were found as the sources in a linear blind source separation strategy. Changes in steady-state, sometimes referred to as events, are characterized by their change in real and reactive power (P and Q). Ultimately, the results may be applied to other features in an attempt to improve the separation between clusters. The preliminary results point toward a mixed scenario: large appliances (roughly above 400W) were easily identified, but the small appliances typically clustered together and were difficult to separate. We conclude that the errors occur during clustering which indicates that, in order to increase the purity of the clusters, perhaps other features could be used.},

We show that this approach shortens platform development time-to-result for novice graduate students, making custom platforms broadly accessible.},

@article{Zeifman2010,
abstract = {Significant saving in energy consumption can be achieved by better energy management and control in residential buildings. More advanced control approaches require real-time information on the appliances in use. A straightforward method to obtain this information uses a power sensor attached to each household appliance of interest. Unfortunately, this method is costly and requires significant installation and maintenance efforts. A more sophisticated way to obtain appliance-specific data is by disaggregation of total power consumption data acquired at the main breaker level. Such nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) uses a single point of power measurement (e.g., of the electric feed for the whole house), combined with special signal processing techniques. Our paper presents overviews and test results for two novel NIALM approaches we are developing and testing. The first system uses an inexpensive off-the-shelf sensor (TED – The Energy Detective) to obtain real power data at a 1 Hz sampling rate. A statistical algorithm, optimally implementing historical data on power draws and power consumption patterns, has been developed for this system. The algorithm is capable of semi-automatic detection of major household appliances and outperforms the known NIALM algorithms in terms of detection accuracy. The second system relies on a custom-built sensor capable of sampling voltage and current at a rate of up to 100 kHz. At this sampling rate, voltage and current waveforms and their features are used to identify and track a much broader range of household appliances.},

abstract = {Access to the nacelle of wind turbine generators to assess machinery running condition is a significant and universal problem. In the United States, modern condition based maintenance (CBM) data acquisition and communications hardware may not even be allowed to be installed in the nacelle, depending on warranty and other business arrangements between the owner, operator, and wind turbine manufacturer. As wind turbine warranties end, the problem of economically monitoring machinery health and maintaining turbine availability falls to the owner/operator. Work accomplished under this NYSERDA project has, based on site and lab tests, established the feasibility of using non-intrusive advanced vibration-based diagnostic/prognostic methodology. The innovation is that all measurements are taken at the base of the tower – access to the nacelle or sensors mounted on the gearbox and generator are not required. As related herein, a portable, easy-to-use data acquisition and processing system has been established and a prototype has been used to acquire and effectively process lab and field data. Initial use by and feedback from potential users has been positive. Implementing his technology can effectively increase the availability of wind turbines, reduce greenhouse gases, and use/advance the technology and industrial base in New York State.},

abstract = {With over half of the world's population now living in urban areas, and predicted to reach two thirds within 20 years, cities, especially in developing countries, are confronting the challenges of providing access to basic services (such as housing, transport, water and waste management), and addressing energy consumption, health hazards, pollution, and carbon emissions. Cities consume 75{\%} of the world's natural resources, 80{\%} of the global energy supply and produce approximately 75{\%} of the global carbon emissions. In general, fossil fuel prices (coal, natural gas and crude oil) have risen steadily since the late 1990s. This raises serious questions about the future sustainability of cities in terms of energy supply, their role in meeting global carbon emission reduction targets and their ability to participate in the carbon economy. Nonetheless, this unprecedented rate of urban growth also represents a unique chance to build more sustainable, innovative and equitable urban areas. UNEP is supporting cities in their transition to sustainability, through knowledge sharing, capacity building, technology transfer and peer to peer exchanges.},

abstract = {This paper present modelling of long-term energy demand forecast in the main economic sectors of Tanzania. The forecast of energy demand for all economic sectors is analyzed by using the Model for Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED) for a study period from 2010-2040. In the study three scenarios namely business as usual (BAU), low economic consumption (LEC) and high economic consumption scenario (HEC) were formulated to simulate possible future long-term energy demand based on socio-economic and technological development with the base year of 2010. Results from all scenario suggests an increased energy demand in consuming sectors with biomass being a dominant energy form in service and household sectors in a study period. Predicted energy demand is projected to increase at a growth rate of 4.1{\%} and reach 74 MTOE in 2040 under BAU scenario. The growth rates for LEC and HEC are projected at 3.5{\%} and 5.1{\%} reaching 62 MTOE and 91 MTOE in 2040 respectively. Electricity demand increases at a rate of 8.5{\%} to reach 4236 kTOE in 2040 under BAU scenario while electricity demand under LEC and HEC increases to 3693 kTOE and 5534 kTOE in 2040 respectively. Sectrorial predicted demand results under both scenarios determines high demand of biomass for service and household sectors with decreasing demand of biomass in industry sector. Transport sectors predicted energy demand pattern suggests an increased demand in passenger transport than freight transport in both scenarios. Final energy demand per capita in both scenario show an increased trend with lower growth in LEC scenario while there is a decrease in energy intensity throughout study period.},

abstract = {Many countries are rolling out smart electricity meters. These measure a home's total power demand. However, research into consumer behaviour suggests that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the 'ground truth' demand of individual appliances. In this context, we present UK-DALE: an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from five houses, one of which was recorded for 655 days, the longest duration we are aware of for any energy dataset at this sample rate. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate to recognize house numbers captured in street view images. We formulate the problem as sequence recognition and present an integrated model by combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Our method utilizes representation capability of CNN to model the highly variable appearance of digits. Meanwhile, HMM is used to handle the dynamics of the image sequence. They are combined in a hybrid way to form the Hybrid CNN-HMM. Using this model, we can perform training and recognition both at the whole image level without explicit segmentation. The model makes CNN applicable to dynamic problems. Experiments show that the Hybrid CNN-HMM can dramatically boost the performance of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-HMM. We evaluate different local features, e.g. LBP, SIFT and HOG, as observations fed into HMM and find CNN features consistently surpass those hand-engineered features with respect to recognition accuracy. To gain insight into performance difference of the features, we map them from the high-dimensional space to a 2-D plane by the t-SNE algorithm to visualize their semantic clustering with respect to the task. The visualization clearly justified the efficiency of features learnt by CNN.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of energy conservation and optimization in residential environments by providing users with useful information to solicit a change in consumption behavior. Taking care to highly limit the costs of installation and management, our work proposes a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) approach, which consists of disaggregating the whole-house power consumption into the individual portions associated to each device. State of the art NILM algorithms need monitoring data sampled at high frequency, thus requiring high costs for data collection and management. In this paper, we propose an NILM approach that relaxes the requirements on monitoring data since it uses total active power measurements gathered at low frequency (about 1 Hz). The proposed approach is based on the use of Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMM) in conjunction with context information related to the user presence in the house and the hourly utilization of appliances. Through a set of tests, we investigated how the use of these additional context-awareness features could improve disaggregation results with respect to the basic FHMM algorithm. The tests have been performed by using Tracebase, an open dataset made of data gathered from real home environments.},

Recent approaches to this source separation problem are based on factorial hidden Markov models (FHMM). Drawbacks are the needed knowledge of HMM models for all loads, what is infeasible for large buildings, and the large combinatorial complexity. Our approach trains HMM with two emission probabilities, one for the single load to be extracted and the other for the aggregate power signal. A Gaussian distribution is used to model observations of the single load whereas observations of the aggregate signal are modeled with a Deep Neural Network (DNN). By doing so, a single load can be extracted from the aggregate power signal without knowledge of the remaining loads. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on the Reference Energy Disaggregation (REDD) dataset.},

abstract = {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states. Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima. In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a "robust" mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time. Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice. The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.},

abstract = {Buildings across the world contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption and are thus stakeholders in grid operations. Towards the development of a smart grid, utilities and governments across the world are encouraging smart meter deployments. High resolution (often at every 15 minutes) data from these smart meters can be used to understand and optimize energy consumptions in buildings. In addition to smart meters, buildings are also increasingly managed with Building Management Systems (BMS) which control different sub-systems such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). With the advent of these smart meters, increased usage of BMS and easy availability and widespread installation of ambient sensors, there is a deluge of building energy data. This data has been leveraged for a variety of applications such as demand response, appliance fault detection and optimizing HVAC schedules. Beyond the traditional use of such data sets, they can be put to effective use towards making buildings smarter and hence driving every possible bit of energy efficiency. Effective use of this data entails several critical areas from sensing to decision making and participatory involvement of occupants. Picking from wide literature in building energy efficiency, we identify five crust areas (also referred to as 5 Is) for realizing data driven energy efficiency in buildings : i) instrument optimally; ii) interconnect sub-systems; iii) inferred decision making; iv) involve occupants and v) intelligent operations. We classify prior work as per these 5 Is and dis-cuss challenges, opportunities and applications across them. Building upon these 5 Is we discuss a well studied problem in building energy efficiency -non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and how research in this area spans across the 5 Is.},

abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources increases the complexity in mantaining the power grid. In particular, the highly dynamic nature of generation and consumption demands for a better utilization of energy resources, which seen the cost of storage infrastructure, can only be achieved through demand-response. Accordingly, the availability of energy and potential overload situations can be reflected using a price signal. The effectiveness of this mechanism arises from the flexibility of device operation, which is nevertheless heavily reliant on the exchange of information between the grid and its consumers. In this paper, we investigate the capability of an interactive energy management system to timely inform users on energy usage, in order to promote an optimal use of local resources. In particular, we analyze data being collected in several households in Italy and Austria to gain insights into usage behavior and drive the design of more effective systems. The outcome is the formulation of energy efficiency policies for residential buildings, as well as the design of an energy management system, consisting of hardware measurement units and a management software. The Mj$\backslash$"olnir framework, which we release for open use, provides a platform where various feedback concepts can be implemented and assessed. This includes widgets displaying disaggregated and aggregated consumption information, as well as daily production and tailored advices. The formulated policies were implemented as an advisor widget able to autonomously analyze usage and provide tailored energy feedback.},

abstract = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technology offering methods to identify appliances in homes based on their consumption characteristics and the total household demand. Recently, many different novel NILM approaches were introduced, tested on real-world data and evaluated with a common evaluation metric. However, the fair comparison between different NILM approaches even with the usage of the same evaluation metric is nearly impossible due to incomplete or missing problem definitions. Each NILM approach typically is evaluated under different test scenarios. Test results are thus influenced by the considered appliances, the number of used appliances, the device type representing the appliance and the pre-processing stages denoising the consumption data. This paper introduces a novel complexity measure of aggregated consumption data providing an assessment of the problem complexity affected by the used appliances, the appliance characteristics and the appliance usage over time. We test our load disaggregation complexity on different real-world datasets and with a state-of-the-art NILM approach. The introduced disaggregation complexity measure is able to classify the disaggregation problem based on the used appliance set and the considered measurement noise.},

abstract = {—While perception tasks such as visual object recognition and text understanding play an important role in human intelligence, the subsequent tasks that involve inference, reasoning and planning require an even higher level of intelligence. The past few years have seen major advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a general introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this survey, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics like Bayesian treatment of neural networks.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation, aims to disaggregate a household's electricity consumption into constituent appliances. More than three decades of work in NILM has resulted in the development of several novel algorithmic approaches. However, despite these advancements, two core challenges still exist: i) disaggregating low power consumption appliances and ii) distinguishing between multiple instances of similar appliances. These challenges are becoming increasingly important due to an increasing number of appliances and increased usage of electronics in homes. Previous approaches have attempted to solve these problems using expensive hardware involving high sampling rates better suited to laboratory settings, or using additional number of sensors, limiting the ease of deployment. In this work, we explore using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) power line communication (PLC) modems as an inexpensive and easy to deploy alternative solution to these problems. We use the reduction in bandwidth between two PLC modems, caused due to the change in PLC modulation scheme when different appliances are operated as a signature for an appliance. Since the noise generated in the powerline is dependent both on type and location of an appliance, we believe that our technique based on PLC modems can be a promising addition for solving NILM.},

abstract = {This paper reports a 15 weeks study of artistic eco-feedback deployed in six houses with an innovative sensing infrastructure and visualization strategy. The paper builds on previous work that showed a significant decrease in user awareness after a short period with a relapse in consumption. In this study we aimed to investigate if new forms of feedback could overcome this issue, maintaining the users awareness for longer periods of time. The study presented here aims at understanding if people are more aware of their energy consumption after the installation of a new, art inspired eco-feedback. The research question was then: does artistic eco-feedback provide an increased awareness over normal informative feedback? And does that awareness last longer? To answer this questions participants were interviewed and their consumption patterns analyzed. The main contribution of the paper is to advance our knowledge about the effectiveness of eco-feedback and provide guidelines for implementation of novel eco-feedback visualizations that overcome the relapse behavior pattern.},

abstract = {Dynamic load management, i.e., allowing electricity utilities to remotely turn electric appliances in households on or off, represents a key element of the smart grid. Appliances should however only be disconnected from mains when no negative side effects, e.g., loss of data or thawing food, are incurred thereby. This motivates the use of appliance identification techniques, which determine the type of an attached appliance based on the continuous sampling of its power consumption. While various implementations based on different sampling resolutions have been presented in existing literature, the achievable classification accuracies have rarely been analyzed. We address this shortcoming and evaluate the accuracy of appliance identification based on the characteristic features of traces collected during the 24 hours of a day. We evaluate our algorithm using more than 1,000 traces of different electrical appliances' power consumptions. The results show that our approach can identify most of the appliances at high accuracy.},

abstract = {Research on Smart Grids has recently focused on the energy monitoring issue, with the objective to maximize the user consumption awareness in building contexts on one hand, and to provide a detailed description of customer habits to the utilities on the other. One of the hottest topic in this field is represented by Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM): it refers to those techniques aimed at decomposing the consumption aggregated data acquired at a single point of measurement into the diverse consumption profiles of appliances operating in the electrical system under study. The focus here is on unsupervised algorithms, which are the most interesting and of practical use in real case scenarios. Indeed, these methods rely on a sustainable amount of a-priori knowledge related to the applicative context of interest, thus minimizing the user intervention to operate, and are targeted to extract all information to operate directly from the measured aggregate data. This paper reports and describes the most promising unsupervised NILM methods recently proposed in the literature, by dividing them into two main categories: load classification and source separation approaches. An overview of the public available dataset used on purpose and a comparative analysis of the algorithms performance is provided, together with a discussion of challenges and future research directions.},

Be- cause it replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neural net- works, end-to-end learning allows us to handle a diverse variety of speech includ- ing noisy environments, accents and different languages. Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system [26]. Because of this efficiency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior ar- chitectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets. Finally, using a technique called Batch Dispatch with GPUs in the data center, we show that our system can be inexpensively deployed in an online setting, deliver- ing low latency when serving users at scale.},

The study reveals that there is inefficient utilization of energy in the major economic sectors of the country. This study presented several energy conservation opportunities to cause energy savings and identified about six major areas through which energy conservation measures can effectively cause some savings in energy and allow for its stability. Such areas of focus for application of energy conservation measures include manufacturing/industrial setup, office and residential buildings, power generation and distribution, transportation, energy conservation through waste control etc. Various measures that need to be considered and appropriately addressed in moving towards energy sustainability in Nigeria have been recommended among which are energy use in ventilating equipment, lighting, electrically operated industrial machines and engines, design for energy-efficient buildings etc.},

Studies have shown that having device- level energy information can cause users to conserve significant amounts of en- ergy, but current electricitymeters only reportwhole-home data. Thus, developing algorithmic methods for disaggregation presents a key technical challenge in the effort to maximize energy conservation. In this paper, we examine a large scale energy disaggregation task, and apply a novel extension of sparse coding to this problem. In particular, we develop a method, based upon structured prediction, for discriminatively training sparse coding algorithms specifically to maximize disaggregation performance. We show that this significantly improves the perfor- mance of sparse coding algorithms on the energy task and illustrate how these disaggregation results can provide useful information about energy usage.},

Energy disaggregation researchers require datasets of the power demand from individual appliances and the whole-home power demand. Multiple such datasets have been released over the last few years but provide metadata in a disparate array of formats including CSV files and plain-text README files. At best, the lack of a standard metadata schema makes it unnecessarily time-consuming to write software to process multiple datasets and, at worse, the lack of a standard means that crucial information is simply absent from some datasets. We propose a metadata schema for representing appliances, meters, buildings, datasets, prior knowledge about appliances and appliance models. The schema is relational and provides a simple but powerful inheritance mechanism.},

However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi- Markovianity, which has been developed in the parametric setting to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicitduration HDP-HSMM and develop posterior sampling algorithms for efficient inference in both the direct-assignment and weak-limit approximation settings. We demonstrate the utility of the model and our inference methods on synthetic data as well as experiments on a speaker diarization problem and an example of learning the patterns in Morse code.},

abstract = {Many countries are rolling out smart electricity meters. These measure a home's total power demand. However, research into consumer behaviour suggests that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the `ground truth' demand of individual appliances. We present `UK-DALE': an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from four homes, one of which was recorded for 499 days, the longest duration we are aware of for similar datasets. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate to recognize house numbers captured in street view images. We formulate the problem as sequence recognition and present an integrated model by combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Our method utilizes representation capability of CNN to model the highly variable appearance of digits. Meanwhile, HMM is used to handle the dynamics of the image sequence. They are combined in a hybrid way to form the Hybrid CNN-HMM. Using this model, we can perform training and recognition both at the whole image level without explicit segmentation. The model makes CNN applicable to dynamic problems. Experiments show that the Hybrid CNN-HMM can dramatically boost the performance of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-HMM. We evaluate different local features, e.g. LBP, SIFT and HOG, as observations fed into HMM and find CNN features consistently surpass those hand-engineered features with respect to recognition accuracy. To gain insight into performance difference of the features, we map them from the high-dimensional space to a 2-D plane by the t-SNE algorithm to visualize their semantic clustering with respect to the task. The visualization clearly justified the efficiency of features learnt by CNN.},

abstract = {Signals and datasets that arise in physical and engineering applications, as well as social, genetics, biomolecular, and many other domains, are becoming increasingly larger and more complex. In contrast to traditional time and image signals, data in these domains are supported by arbitrary graphs. Signal processing on graphs extends concepts and techniques from traditional signal processing to data indexed by generic graphs. This paper studies the concepts of low and high frequencies on graphs, and low-, high- and band-pass graph signals and graph filters. In traditional signal processing, these concepts are easily defined because of a natural frequency ordering that has a physical interpretation. For signals residing on graphs, in general, there is no obvious frequency ordering. We propose a definition of total variation for graph signals that naturally leads to a frequency ordering on graphs and defines low-, high-, and band-pass graph signals and filters. We study the design of graph filters with specified frequency response, and illustrate our approach with applications to sensor malfunction detection and data classification.},

abstract = {Utilities are currently deploying smart electricity meters in millions of households worldwide to collect fine-grained electricity consumption data. We present an approach to automatically analyzing this data to enable personalized and scalable energy efficiency programs for private households. In particular, we develop and evaluate a system that uses supervised machine learning techniques to automatically estimate specific “characteristics” of a household from its electricity consumption. The characteristics are related to a household's socio-economic status, its dwelling, or its appliance stock. We evaluate our approach by analyzing smart meter data collected from 4232 households in Ireland at a 30-min granularity over a period of 1.5 years. Our analysis shows that revealing characteristics from smart meter data is feasible, as our method achieves an accuracy of more than 70{\%} over all households for many of the characteristics and even exceeds 80{\%} for some of the characteristics. The findings are applicable to all smart metering systems without making changes to the measurement infrastructure. The inferred knowledge paves the way for targeted energy efficiency programs and other services that benefit from improved customer insights. On the basis of these promising results, the paper discusses the potential for utilities as well as policy and privacy implications.},

Studies have shown that simply providing disaggregated data to the consumer improves energy consumption behavior. However, placing individual sensors on every device in a home is not presently a practical solution. Disaggregation provides a feasible method for providing energy usage behavior data to the consumer which utilizes currently existing infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel framework to perform the energy disaggregation task. We model each individual device as a single-input, single-output system, where the output is the power consumed by the device and the input is the device usage. In this framework, the task of disaggregation translates into finding inputs for each device that generates our observed power consumption. We describe an implementation of this framework, and show its results on simulated data as well as data from a small-scale experiment.},

Through two pilot projects, in-home displays were installed in 33 Norwegian homes, and we provide a qualitative analysis of the effects. The results point to the potential differences in the ways households interact with the in-home displays. The effects differed among various groups according to people's previous experiences with monitoring and their level of affluence. In the sample, affluent respondents living in detached houses tended to be accustomed to monitoring consumption before the display was introduced. These families used the display for controlling that “nothing was wrong”, but they did not use the information provided by the display to initiate new energy saving measures. In contrast, among less affluent flat owners the notion of “control” was specifically linked to the family's management of finances, and in this sense the displays empowered them. In addition, the results indicate that the in-home display for this group resulted in electricity savings. The study adds to earlier research on the effects of in-home displays by showing the importance of previous experience with monitoring electricity for the effects of feedback and by highlighting not only energy savings but also social effects of displays.},

@article{Agyeman2015,
abstract = {The concern of energy price hikes and the impact of climate change because of energy generation and usage forms the basis for residential building energy conservation. Existing energy meters do not provide much information about the energy usage of the individual appliance apart from its power rating. The detection of the appliance energy usage will not only help in energy conservation, but also facilitate the demand response (DR) market participation as well as being one way of building energy conservation. However, energy usage by individual appliance is quite difficult to estimate. This paper proposes a novel approach: an unsupervised disaggregation method, which is a variant of the hidden Markov model (HMM), to detect an appliance and its operation state based on practicable measurable parameters from the household energy meter. Performing experiments in a practical environment validates our proposed method. Our results show that our model can provide appliance detection and power usage information in a non-intrusive manner, which is ideal for enabling power conservation efforts and participation in the demand response market.},

@techreport{Deng2014,
abstract = {This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the application areas that have already been transformed by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated research efforts, including natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered by multi-task deep learning. In Chapter 1, we provide the background of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature, deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular, selected chronological development of speech recognition is used to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition. In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods, one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques. Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category, which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative, unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the three-way categorization scheme. In Chapters 7-11, we select a set of typical and successful applications of deep learning in diverse areas of signal and information processing and of applied artificial intelligence. In Chapter 7, we review the applications of deep learning to speech and audio processing, with emphasis on speech recognition organized according to several prominent themes. In Chapters 8, we present recent results of applying deep learning to language modeling and natural language processing. Chapter 9 is devoted to selected applications of deep learning to information retrieval including Web search. In Chapter 10, we cover selected applications of deep learning to image object recognition in computer vision. Selected applications of deep learning to multi-modal processing and multi-task learning are reviewed in Chapter 11. Finally, an epilogue is given in Chapter 12 to summarize what we presented in earlier chapters and to discuss future challenges and directions.},

abstract = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the analysis of the aggregate power consumption of electric loads in order to recognize the existence and the consumption profile of each individual appliance. In this paper, we briefly describe our ongoing research on an unsupervised NILM system suitable for applications in the residential sector. The proposed system consists of the typical stages of an event-based NILM system with the difference that only unsupervised algorithms are utilized in each stage eliminating the need for a pre-training process and providing wider applicability. In the event detector, a grid-based clustering algorithm is utilized in order to segment the power signals into transient and steady-state sections. Macroscopic features are extracted from the detected events and used in a mean-shift clustering algorithm. The system is tested on the publicly available BLUED dataset and shows event detection and clustering accuracy more than 98{\%}. The system also shows possible disaggregation up to 92{\%} of the energy of phase A of the BLUED dataset. Moreover, the system has been utilized in an energy-disaggregation competition held by Belkin and achieved a score within the top ten results with disaggregation of more than 93{\%} of the total time.},
