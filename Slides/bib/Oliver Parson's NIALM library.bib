abstract = {In this paper, we present AgentSwitch, a prototype agent-based platform to solve the electricity tariff selection problem. AgentSwitch incorporates novel algorithms to make predictions of hourly energy usage as well as detect (and suggest to the user) deferrable loads that could be shifted to off-peak times to maximise savings. To take advantage of group discounts from energy retailers, we develop a new scalable collective energy purchasing mechanism, based on the Shapley value, that ensures individual members of a collective (interacting through AgentSwitch) fairly share the discounts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms we empirically evaluate them individually on real-world data (with up to 3000 homes in the UK) and show that they outperform the state of the art in their domains. Finally, to ensure individual components are accountable in providing recommendations, we provide a novel provenance-tracking service to record the ?ow of data in the system, and therefore provide users with a means of checking the provenance of suggestions from AgentSwitch and assess their reliability.},

@inproceedings{Parson2012,
abstract = {Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is the process of disaggregating a household's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. In this paper we propose an approach by which individual appliances can be iteratively separated from an aggregate load. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances, nor does it assume complete knowledge of the appliances present in the household. Instead, we propose an approach in which prior models of general appliance types are tuned to specific appliance instances using only signatures extracted from the aggregate load. The tuned appliance models are then used to estimate each appliance's load, which is subsequently subtracted from the aggregate load. This process is applied iteratively until all appliances for which prior behaviour models are known have been disaggregated. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach using the REDD data set, and show the disaggregation performance when using our training approach is comparable to when sub-metered training data is used. We also present a deployment of our system as a live application and demonstrate the potential for personalised energy saving feedback.},

abstract = {We present a system and study of personalized energy-related recommendation. AgentSwitch utilizes electricity usage data collected from users' households over a period of time to realize a range of smart energy-related recommendations on energy tariffs, load detection and usage shifting. The web service is driven by a third party real-time energy tariff API (uSwitch), an energy data store, a set of algorithms for usage prediction, and appliance-level load disaggregation. We present the system design and user evaluation consisting of interviews and interface walkthroughs. We recruited participants from a previous study during which three months of their household's energy use was recorded to evaluate personalized recommendations in AgentSwitch. Our contributions are a) a systems architecture for personalized energy services; and b) findings from the evaluation that reveal challenges in designing energy-related recommender systems. In response to the challenges we formulate design recommendations to mitigate barriers to switching tariffs, to incentivize load shifting, and to automate energy management.},

@article{Ghahramani1997,
abstract = {Previous researchers developed new learning architectures for sequential data by extending conventional hidden Markov models through the use of distributed state representations. Although exact inference and parameter estimation in these architectures is computationally intractable, Ghahramani and Jordan (1997) showed that approximate inference and parameter estimation in one such architecture, factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), is feasible in certain circumstances. However, the learning algorithm proposed by these investigators, based on variational techniques, is difficult to understand and implement and is limited to the study of real-valued data sets. This chapter proposes an alternative method for approximate inference and parameter estimation in FHMMs based on the perspective that FHMMs are a generalization of a well-known class of statistical models known as generalized additive models (GAMs; Hastie {\&} Tibshirani, 1990). Using existing statistical techniques for GAMs as a guide, we have developed the generalized backfitting algorithm. This algorithm computes customized error signals for each hidden Markov chain of an FHMM and then trains each chain one at a time using conventional techniques from the hidden Markov models literature. Relative to previous perspectives on FHMMs, we believe that the viewpoint taken here has a number of advantages. First, it places FHMMs on firm statistical foundations by relating them to a class of models that are well studied in the statistics community, yet it generalizes this class of models in an interesting way. Second, it leads to an understanding of how FHMMs can be applied to many different types of time-series data, including Bernoulli and multinomial data, not just data that are real valued. Finally, it leads to an effective learning procedure for FHMMs that is easier to understand and easier to implement than existing learning procedures. Simulation results suggest that FHMMs trained with the generalized backfitting algorithm are a practical and powerful tool for analyzing sequential data.},

abstract = {Improved feedback on electricity consumption may provide a tool for customers to better control their consumption and ultimately save energy. This paper asks which kind of feedback is most successful. For this purpose, a psychological model is presented that illustrates how and why feedback works. Relevant features of feedback are identified that may determine its effectiveness: frequency, duration, content, breakdown, medium and way of presentation, comparisons, and combination with other instruments. The paper continues with an analysis of international experience in order to find empirical evidence for which kinds of feedback work best. In spite of considerable data restraints and research gaps, there is some indication that the most successful feedback combines the following features: it is given frequently and over a long time, provides an appliance-specific breakdown, is presented in a clear and appealing way, and uses computerized and interactive tools.},

@article{Ramchurn2012,
abstract = {The phenomenal growth in material wealth experienced in developed countries throughout the twentieth century has largely been driven by the availability of cheap energy derived from fossil fuels (originally coal, then oil, and most recently natural gas). However, the continued availability of this cheap energy cannot be taken for granted given the growing concern that increasing demand for these fuels (and particularly, demand for oil) will outstrip our ability to produce them (so called `peak oil'). Many mature oil and gas fields around the world have already peaked and their annual production is now steadily declining. Predictions of when world oil production will peak vary between 0-20 years into the future, but even the most conservative estimates provide little scope for complacency given the significant price increases that peak oil is likely to precipitate. Furthermore, many of the oil and gas reserves that do remain are in environmentally or politically sensitive regions of the world where threats to supply create increased price volatility (as evidenced by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and 2011 civil unrest in the Middle East). Finally, the growing consensus on the long term impact of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels suggests that even if peak oil is avoided, and energy security assured, a future based on fossil fuel use will expose regions of the world to damaging climate change that will make the lives of many of the world's poorest people even harder.},

abstract = {The continuous growth of energy needs and the fact that unpredictable energy demand is mostly served by unsustainable (i.e. fossil-fuel) power generators have given rise to the development of Demand Response (DR) mechanisms for flattening energy demand. Building effective DR mechanisms and user awareness on power consumption can significantly benefit from fine-grained monitoring of user consumption at the appliance level. However, installing and maintaining such a monitoring infrastructure in residential settings can be quite expensive. In this paper, we study the problem of fine-grained appliance power-consumption monitoring based on one house-level meter and few plug-level meters. We explore the trade-off between monitoring accuracy and cost, and exhaustively find the minimum subset of plug-level meters that maximize accuracy. As exhaustive search is time- and resource-consuming, we define a heuristic approach that finds the optimal set of plug-level meters without utilizing any other sets of plug-level meters. Based on experiments with real data, we found that few plug-level meters - when appropriately placed - can very accurately disaggregate the total real power consumption of a residential setting and verified the effectiveness of our heuristic approach.},

Remote monitoring can reduce the amount of recurring admissions to hospital, facilitate more efficient clinical visits with objective results, and may reduce the length of a hospital stay for individuals who are living at home. Telemonitoring can also be applied on a long-term basis to elderly persons to detect gradual deterioration in their health status, which may imply a reduction in their ability to live independently. Mobility is a good indicator of health status and thus by monitoring mobility, clinicians may assess the health status of elderly persons. This article reviews the architecture of health smart home, wearable, and combination systems for the remote monitoring of the mobility of elderly persons as a mechanism of assessing the health status of elderly persons while in their own living environment.},

abstract = {Restructuring electricity grids to meet the increased demand caused by the electrification of transport and heating, while making greater use of intermittent renewable energy sources, represents one of the greatest engineering challenges of our day. This modern electric- ity grid, in which both electricity and information flow in two directions between large numbers of widely dis- tributed suppliers and generators {\{}--{\}} commonly termed the ?smart grid? {\{}--{\}} represents a radical reengineering of infrastructure which has changed little over the last hundred years. However, the autonomous behaviour expected of the smart grid, its distributed nature, and the existence of multiple stakeholders each with their own incentives and interests, challenges existing engineering approaches. In this challenge paper, we describe why we believe that artificial intelligence, and particularly, the fields of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems are essential for delivering the smart grid as it is envisioned. We present some recent work in this area and describe many of the challenges that still remain.},
