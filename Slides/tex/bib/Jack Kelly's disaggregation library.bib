abstract = {Research on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), a technique for discerning individual appliance operation from whole-house measurements, has been underway for over 20 years [4],[5]. Most implementations utilize changes in the total real (P) and reactive (Q) power of a building as signatures for each appliance state transition. There are a small number of commercially available systems that implement NILM, albeit marketed for utilities as a tool for performing load research. As a proof of concept, and in order to obtain preliminary data that would help us evaluate the feasibility of using NILM to support electricity audits in a residential building, we decided to focus our attention on one of the top residential loads: the refrigerator. We installed a NILM prototype system in an apartment building, and a plug-level power meter was used to accurately track the individual consumption of this appliance. The experiment consisted in monitoring this load for a week, using the two methodologies (NILM and pluglevel meters), and then comparing the estimated energy consumption as computed by each.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is the process of breaking down a house-
hold's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. In this paper
we propose an approach by which individual appliances are iteratively separated
from the aggregate load. Our approach does not require training data to be col-
lected by sub-metering individual appliances. Instead, prior models of general
appliance types are tuned to specific appliance instances using only signatures ex-
tracted from the aggregate load. The tuned appliance models are used to estimate
each appliance's load, which is subsequently subtracted from the aggregate load.
We evaluate our approach using the REDD data set, and show that it can disag-
gregate 35{\%} of a typical household's total energy consumption to an accuracy of
83{\%} by only disaggregating three of its highest energy consuming appliances.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive statistical review of data obtained from a wide range of literature on the most widely used electrical appliances in the UK residential load sector. It focuses on individual appliances and begins by consideration of the electrical operations performed by the load. This approach allows for the loads to be categorised based on the electrical characteristics, and also provides information on the reactive power characteristics of the load, which is often neglected from standard consumption statistics. This data is particularly important for power system analysis. In addition to this, device ownership statistics and probability distribution functions of power demand are presented for the main residential loads. Although the data presented is primarily intended as a resource for the development of load profiles for power system analysis, it contains a large volume of information which provides a useful database for the wider research community.},

abstract = {The Non-Intrusive Load Monitor (NILM) is a device that utilizes voltage and current measurements to monitor an entire system from a single reference point. The NILM and associated software convert the V/I signal to spectral power envelopes that can be searched to determine when a transient occurs. The identification of this signal can then be determined by an expert classifier and a series of these classifications can be used to diagnose system failures or improper operation. Current NILM research conducted at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems (LEES) is exploring the application and expansion of NILM technology for the use of monitoring shipboard systems. This thesis presents the ginzu application that implements a detect-classify-verify loop that locates the indexes of transients, identifies them using a decision-tree based expert classifier, and then generates a summary event file containing relevant information. The ginzu application provides a command-line interface between streaming preprocessed power data (PREP) and an included graphical user interface. This software was developed using thousands of hours of archived data from the Coast Guard Cutters ESCANABA (WMEC-907) and SENECA (WMEC-906). A validation of software effectiveness was conducted as the software was installed onboard ESCANABA.},

abstract = {A method for unsupervised disaggregation of appliance signatures from smart meter data is presented. The primary feature used for unsupervised learning relates to abrupt transitions or magnitude changes in the power waveform. The method consists of a sequence of procedures for appliance signature identification, and disaggregation using hidden Markov modeling (HMM), and residual analysis. The key contributions are (a) a novel 'segmented' application of the Viterbi algorithm for sequence decoding with the HMM, (b) details of establishing observation and state transition probabilities for the HMM, and (c) procedures for careful handling of low power signatures. Results show that the method is effective for magnitude-based disaggregation, and provide insights for a more complete solution.},

The study shows that local measurement of variations in active and reactive power is sufficient in most cases to identify an appliance. This measurement must be synchronized with the events. This necessitates a numerical measurement device which can monitor the signal and isolate the times when variations occur. In a second stage, a sorting algorithm identifies the appliance that has operated. An attempt is made to show the feasibility of this device.

abstract = {Obtaining high quality information economically and reliably is always a difficult objective to achieve. The electric power industry and consumers recently face many challenges, such as deregulation, autonomous power systems and power quality. The knowledge of the nature and state of the power systems will undoubtedly be the key in meeting these challenges. The Non-Intrusive Power Monitor is a novel attempt to collect such information with a minimal physical installation. Raw voltage and current are measured at a single location to yield harmonic power signals. They typically carry the fingerprints of the electric loads present in a system, and their analysis can produce such information as the operational and diagnostic status of the loads. The power signals can also be used for the system identification, parameter estimation and energy consumption optimization study. In this research, the power signals are mostly modeled as stochastic processes and various detection, estimation and pattern recognition algorithms are developed to extract desired information. A constant load status identifier is developed in this thesis which can identify the ON and OFF status of electric loads, both from their steady-state power consumptions and transient patterns. The identifier can also classify multiple load events occurring at a same time and estimate states without load events. The power consumed by a variable speed drive is also estimated using the correlations between the fundamental powers and higher harmonic powers. The harmonic signal generated by the imbalance of a rotating machine is estimated to monitor the drive, i.e. its speed and magnitude of the imbalance. The algorithms are thoroughly tested using the data collected at real buildings, and some of them are implemented on-line.},

abstract = {This paper proposes to compare the performance of neural network classifiers between back propagation (BP) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) for pattern analyses of features selection in a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) system. Load recognition for identifying loads being connected and disconnected is applied to a NILM by using a neural network, especially for industrial electrical loads, even though some loads are activated at the nearly same time. In order to accurately decompose the aggregate load into its components, a feature-based model for describing the signatures of individual appliances and load combinations is used. The model will suggest the certain signatures which can be detected for all loads in order to indicate the activities of the separate components. To verify the performance of the model for the features selection, the data sets of the electrical loads and the load recognition techniques apply an electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and a neural network, respectively. The effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition are analyzed and compared by using the back propagation classifier and the learning vector quantization classifier. To obtain a maximum recognition accuracy rate, the calculation of the turn-on transient energy signature employs a window of samples, At, to adaptively segment a transient representative of a class of loads. Experiments performed with a variety of model data sets which reveal the back propagation classifier is superior to the learning quantization classifier in the effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition.},

abstract = {Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) systems require sufficient accurate total load data to separate the load into its major appliances. The most available solutions separate the whole electric energy consumption based on the measurement of all three voltages and currents. Aside from the cost for special measuring devices, the intrusion into the local installation is the main problem for reaching a high market distribution. The use of standard digital electricity meters could avoid this problem but the loss of information of the measured data has to be compensated by more intelligent algorithms and implemented rules to disaggregate the total load trace of only the active power measurements. The paper presents a NIALM approach to analyse data, collected from a standard digital electricity meter. To disaggregate the consumption of the entire active power into its major electrical end uses, an algorithm consisting of clustering methods, a genetic algorithm and a dynamic programming approach is presented. The genetic algorithm is used to combine frequently occurring events to create hypothetical finite state machines to model detectable appliances. The time series of each finite state machine is optimized using a dynamic programming method similar to the viterbi algorithm.},

One approach in the domestic sector is to improve consumer understanding of how much energy is consumed by each of their household appliances. This empowers consumers to make educated decisions on how they can change their lifestyle in an effort to reduce their energy consumption. This report investigates how total household energy consumption can be disaggregated into individual appliances using low granularity data collected from a single point of measurement, such as a smart meter. First, this work discusses how this problem can be solved using combinatorial optimisation. Second, a novel approach is introduced using hidden Markov models to model each appliance. We show through empirical evaluation that our implementation of the hidden Markov model approach outperforms the combinatorial optimisation method. Our future work is then outlined to show how we plan to better model domestic appliances and therefore improve the accuracy of our approach.},

abstract = {Smart electricity meters record the aggregate consumption of an entire building. However, appliance-level information is more useful than aggregate data for a variety of pur- poses including energy management and load forecasting. Disaggregation aims to decompose an aggregate signal into appliance-by-appliance information. Existing disaggregation systems tend to perform well for single-state appliances like toasters but perform less well for multi-state appliances like dish washers and tumble driers. In this paper, we propose an expressive probabilistic graph- ical modelling framework with two main design aims: 1) to represent and disaggregate multi-state appliances and 2) to use as many features from the smart meter signal as possible to maximise disaggregation performance.},

abstract = {The first requirement for any intelligent household energy management system is to accurately measure home energy use. Whole-home energy measurement is cheap and easy to set up because it requires only one sensor where the home connects to the power grid. The collected data can provide useful information for large appliances. However, the only way to monitor smaller devices' energy use is to install an energy meter on every device. This creates a detailed picture of household energy consumption but requires much additional hardware—one meter per device in the home. An alternative, more practical, approach to monitor household energy use includes small devices by using circuit-level power measurements. Two proposed algorithms disaggregate the circuit-level data into device-level estimates. An evaluation of these algorithms produced an average error of less than 5.35 percent for each device. So, they enable the development of highly intelligent automated energy management systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for the development of software for classifying power system disturbances by type from the transient waveform signature. The implementation of classification capability in future transient recorders will enable such features as selective storage of transient data (to better utilize limited storage media) and automated reporting of disturbances to central control facilities. The wavelet transform provides an effective and efficient means of decomposing voltage and current signals of power system transients to detectable and discriminant features. Similarities of power system transients to wide-band signals in other domains, the simultaneous presence of a resonant frequency, its harmonics, and impulse (high-frequency, time-localized) components, make this technique extendible to other classification systems. The classification algorithm uses statistical pattern recognition on features derived from the extreme representation of the transient waveform after processing the transient waveform by a non-orthogonal, quadratic spline wavelet. Training and classification testing use simulated waveforms of a 200 mile, three-phase transmission line produced by the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). A simple Bayesian classifier identifies an unknown transient waveform as a capacitor switching or fault transient, and locates the point of disturbance from one of two possible locations on the transmission line. Due to the effectiveness of the wavelet transform preprocessing, the classification system currently performs at 100 percent accuracy on four transient classes.},

abstract = {Electrical load disaggregation for end-use recognition in the smart home has become an area of study of its own right. The most well-known examples are energy monitoring, health care applications, in-home activity modeling, and home automation. Real-time energy-use analysis for whole-home approaches needs to understand where and when the electrical loads are spent. Studies have shown that individual loads can be detected (and disaggregated) from sampling the power at one single point (e.g. the electric service entrance for the house) using a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approach. In this paper, we focus on the feature extraction and pattern recognition tasks for non-intrusive residential electrical consumption traces. In particular, we develop an algorithm capable of determining the step-changes in signals that occur whenever a device is turned on or off, and which allows for the definition of a unique signature (ID) for each device. This algorithm makes use of features extracted from active and reactive powers and power factor. The classification task is carried out by Support Vector Machines and 5-Nearest Neighbors methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed signature for distinguishing the different loads.},

@phdthesis{Kelly2011,
abstract = {Wise management of electricity consumption is becoming increasingly important. Domestic electricity prices in the UK increased by 35 {\%} over the past 8 years; an upward trend which is unlikely to reverse any time soon. As well as the economic costs, the environmental problems associated with the combustion of fossil fuels are becoming increasingly detrimental to the well-being of many species, including our own. One of the cheapest and easiest ways to improve energy efficiency is to monitor one's electricity consumption using a type of smart meter called a “home energy monitor” available for around {\pounds}40. These display whole-house consumption in real-time, allowing the user to learn which devices and behaviours consume the most energy. Studies have demonstrated that the feedback provided by energy monitors can enable users to reduce consumption by 5-15 {\%}. If every domestic user in the UK reduced electricity consumption by 10 {\%} then the UK's annual CO2 output would be reduced by 6 million tonnes. However, the information displayed by home energy monitors is not as useful as it could be. Home energy monitors measure aggregate consumption for an entire building. Research has demonstrated that disaggregated information describing appliance-by-appliance energy consumption is more effective than aggregate information. Disaggregation was first successfully implemented in the 1980s using sophisticated smart meters which provide rich, multi-dimensional raw sensor data. However, these sophisticated meters are not readily available at present. The main contribution of this project is to design, implement and evaluate three different algorithms for disaggregating the sparse, one-dimensional data output by inexpensive, popular and readily available home energy monitors. Each design is trained to recognise a device on the basis of one or more raw recordings of single-device power consumption (which we call signatures). The system is then given an unseen aggregate signal from which it must infer the start times, run duration and energy consumption of each device activation present in the aggregate data. The first design is a simple prototype which uses a least mean squares approach to matching a signature to an aggregate signal. As expected, this design succeeds only in a very limited set of contexts but the development of this prototype provided valuable insights. The second design represents a novel approach to determining a set of device power states by identifying peaks in the histogram of the device's signature but this design proved to not be ideal. The final design presented in this dissertation represents a novel approach to disaggregation whereby each device is modelled as a power state graph. Each graph vertex (node) represents a power state and each edge represents the conditions necessary to transition from the source to the destination power state. During disaggregation, every possible “fit” of the power state graph to the aggregate data is represented as a tree structure where each tree vertex represents a power state and each tree edge represents the likelihood for the corresponding power state transition. For each complete “fit” of the power state graph to the aggregate data, the disaggregation algorithm reports the start time, the average likelihood, the estimated run time and the estimated total energy consumption. This design has several attractive features: 1) it handles both simple devices and complex devices whose signatures contain power state sequences which repeat an arbitrary number of times; 2) it is probabilistic; 3) a power state graph can be learnt from one or more signatures and 4) the design estimates the energy consumed by each device activation. This design was evaluated by training it to recognise four real devices: a toaster, a kettle, a washing machine and a tumble drier. The system was then given 13 days of real aggregate data. For all devices except the tumble drier it detected every device activation in the aggregate data although there were a few false positives. The system failed to model the tumble drier, possibly because the drier has very rapid state transitions.},

@techreport{PublicAccountsCommittee2011,
abstract = {Under European Directives, all member states are required to install 'intelligent metering systems' - smart meters - to at least 80{\%} of domestic electricity consumers by 2020. The UK Government has opted for a more challenging programme, with plans for energy suppliers to install smart electricity and gas meters in all homes and smaller non-domestic premises in Great Britain by 2019. We welcome the introduction of smart meters, but have concerns over the way the programme has been planned. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (the Department) estimates that the smart meters programme will cost some {\pounds}11.7 billion. This is a large complex programme requiring replacing around 53 million gas and electricity meters with significant uncertainties over the estimated costs and benefits involved.

In particular, it is far from certain that all consumers will benefit from the regulatory requirement placed on suppliers to install smart meters in their homes. We recognise however that the Department will work to ensure that consumers do benefit from being able to monitor their energy costs. The costs of installing smart meters will be borne by consumers through their energy bills, but many of the benefits accrue in the first instance to energy suppliers. No transparent mechanism presently exists for ensuring savings to the supplier are passed on to consumers, and the track record of energy companies to date does not inspire confidence that this will happen.

The Department has acknowledged that it is accountable for delivering the programme, keeping the costs down and ensuring that consumers benefit through reduced bills from the lower costs borne by suppliers and reduced energy use. The Department insists that suppliers are best placed to deliver the programme and that competition between energy suppliers is the best way to ensure consumers benefit from suppliers' savings. We are concerned, however, that past performance suggests that competition does not work effectively in this market and should not be relied on to keep prices low.

There remain significant uncertainties in a number of key areas in the programme. Consumers may not be willing to cooperate with the installation of smart meters: the communications programme which is promised for 2012 is therefore absolutely vital to help consumers use smart meters to reduce consumption. Significant practical difficulties may arise in procuring and installing the required data communications service before the planned roll-out of smart meters in 2014 (at a projected cost of {\pounds}3 billion). The Department needs to address remaining uncertainties by conducting proper trials to identify and manage the risks associated with an IT project involving such a substantial amount of money which is financed by individuals as consumers.

The Department needs to ensure that the vulnerable, those on low incomes and those who use prepayment meters also benefit from smart meters. It would be unacceptable if these consumers bore the costs of smart meters through higher charges without getting a share of the potential benefits. The Government must put in place measures to ensure vulnerable people are not readily disconnected if they fall behind with payments.

There are issues around cyber security which need to be addressed if confidence in this new technology is to be gained by the population who are expected to have smart meters in their home and pay for them.

On the basis of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General,[1] we took evidence from the Department on preparations for the roll-out of smart meters, including the procurement of the Data Communications Service.},

abstract = {The introduction of electricity monitors (in-home displays; IHDs), which show accurate and up-to-the-minute energy usage, is expected to lead to reduction in consumption. Studies of feedback on domestic electricity use have generally supported this view. However, such studies also demonstrate wide variation between households. Examining the heterogeneity of responses is essential for understanding the actual and potential effectiveness of IHDs and in order to target interventions effectively. To explore differences between households' responses to IHDs, we conducted a qualitative study with 21 households who had an IHD for more than six months. Of the 21, only four households continued to refer to the IHD and the findings suggest that attempts to reduce energy consumption were situated in wider social and physical contexts. Further, the participants demonstrated energy saving behaviour before and outside of IHD usage. The patterns of energy behaviours and attempts at electricity conservation could best be understood by categorising the households into three types: the Monitor Enthusiasts (20{\%}), the Aspiring Energy Savers (60{\%}) and the Energy Non-Engaged (20{\%}). The factors of importance in energy behaviour differed between the categories. Financial savings contributed to efforts to reduce energy use but only up to boundaries which varied considerably between households. Social practices and social relationships appeared to constrain what actions households were prepared to undertake, illuminating aspects of inter-household variation. Within the household, all energy users were not equal and we found that women were particularly influential on energy use through their primary responsibility for domestic labour on behalf of the household. The implications of the findings for environmental campaigning are discussed.},

abstract = {In response to growing concerns over climate change and rising energy costs, a number of eco-feedback systems are being tested by researchers. Yet, the interface design aspect of these systems has largely been ignored. Therefore, the role that interface design plays at the component level in driving actual energy savings from users is unclear. In this paper, we evaluate the impact interface design has on eco-feedback performance by investigating five established design components. We conducted a six week empirical study with 43 participants using a prototype eco-feedback interface. Analysis of usage data affirmed a statistically significant inverse correlation between user engagement (measured as logins) and energy consumption. Utilizing this relationship as a basis for performance, we expanded our analysis to evaluate the five design components. The study revealed statistically significant evidence corroborating that historical comparison and incentives are design components that drive higher engagement and thus reductions in energy consumption. Results for the normative comparison and disaggregation components were inconclusive, while results for the rewards and penalization component suggest that a revision to the penalization aspect of the component may be necessary. This study raises pertinent questions regarding the efficacy of various eco-feedback components in eliciting energy savings.},

The first stage divides the consumption in two parts: weather- and illumination-related, and residual consumption, where weather-related consumption refers to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Given the hourly total consumption, we obtain the hourly weather-related and illumination-related electricity consumption, and subtract this out to get residual consumption. The second stage of the model is a flexible, agent-based analytical tool that allows disaggregation of residual consumption into a sum of consumptions by different groups of appliances. This tool can be used for a variety of applications including an optimization of demand-side management and/or a development of a set of desirable patterns for schedules of electricity-related activities in households (within an acceptable range of course) in order to minimize negative effects of high peak demand.},

abstract = {Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) can determine operating schedule of electrical loads in a target system from measurements made at a centralized location, such as the electric utility service entry. NILM is an ideal platform for extracting useful information about any system that uses electromechanical devices. It has a low installation cost and high reliability because it uses a bare minimum of sensors. It is possible to use modem state and parameter estimation algorithms to verify remotely the "health" of electromechanical loads by using NILM to analyze measured waveforms associated with the operation of individual loads. NILM can also monitor the operation of the electrical distribution system itself, identifying situations where two or more otherwise healthy loads interfere with each other's operation through voltage waveform distortion or power quality problems. Strategies for nonintrusive monitoring have developed over the last 20 years. Advances in computing technology make a new wealth of computational tools useful in practical, field-based NILM systems. This article reviews techniques for high-performance nonintrusive load and diagnostic monitoring and illustrates key points with results from field tests.},

abstract = {A new channel model and channel inversion algorithm are presented for correcting symbol sequences that have been corrupted by an unknown combination of known fault mechanisms. The algorithm is similar to the Viterbi algorithm in that it is suitable for situations in which the uncorrupted data string is generated by a known finite-state process, but it is more versatile in that it can correct a much broader class of errors. Of particular importance is the fact that the algorithm corrects common context-sensitive errors, such as symbol changes, transpositions, mergers, splits, insertions, and deletions, which may be assigned different probabilities depending on the context of preceeding and subsequent symbols. As many communication channels can be modeled in this way, this algorithm is a significant extension over the Viterbi algorithm and previous decoding techniques. The notion of channel rules is introduced to provide a framework for the user to specify the channel operation. The algorithm is given in both an off-line form and a recursive form suitable for sequentially presented data streams. In most applications, the recursive form has computational complexity only a constant times that of the Viterbi algorithm},

@article{Shaw1999,
abstract = {This paper describes three methods for estimating the lumped model parameters of an induction motor using startup transient data. A three-phase balanced induction motor is assumed. Measurements of the stator currents and voltages are required for the identification procedure, but no measurements from the motor shaft are needed. The first method presented applies simple models with limited temporal domains of validity and obtains parameter estimates by extrapolating the model error bias to zero. This method does not minimize any specific error criterion and is presented as a means of finding a good initial guess for a conventional iterative maximum-likelihood or least-squares estimator. The second method presented minimizes equation errors in the induction motor model in the least-square sense using a Levenburg-Marquardt iteration. The third identification method is a continuation of the Levenburg-Marquardt method, motivated by observed properties of some pathological loss functions. The third method minimizes errors in the observations in the least-squared sense and is, therefore, a maximum-likelihood estimator under appropriate conditions of normality. The performance of the identification schemes is demonstrated with both simulated and measured data, and parameters obtained using the methods are compared with parameters obtained from standard tests},

Existing disaggregation systems tend to perform well for single-state appliances like toasters but perform less well for multi-state appliances like dish washers and tumble driers.

abstract = {There is a need for flexible, inexpensive metering technologies that can be deployed in many different monitoring scenarios. Individual loads may be expected to compute information about their power consumption. Utility providers, facilities managers, and other consumers will likely find innumerable ways to mine information if made available in a useful form. However, appropriate sensing and information delivery systems remain a chief bottleneck for many applications, and metering hardware and access to metered information will likely limit the implementation of new electric energy conservation strategies in the near future. This thesis presents solutions for two long standing problems in nonintrusive power and diagnostic monitoring. First, a high-resolution, physically windowed sensor architecture that is well-suited for energy score-keeping and diagnostic applications will be discussed. The sensor can track a large-scale main signal while capturing small-scale variations. The prototype system uses digital techniques to reconstruct an observed current with a high effective bit resolution. The sensor measures a small current signal using a closed-loop Hall sensor. and extends the range by driving a compensation current with a high performance current source through an auxiliary winding. The system combines the compensation command and the sampled output of the residual sensor to reconstruct the input signal with high bit resolution and bandwidth. Second, a long-standing problem in nonintrusive power monitoring involves the tracking of power consumption in the in the presence of loads with a continuously variable power demand. Two new techniques have been developed for automatically disaggregating, in real-time. different classes of continuously variable power electronic loads which draw distorted line currents. Experimental results of the proposed power estimator extracting the power consumption of common variable power loads such as a variable speed drive, a computer, and a light dimmer are presented.},

@article{Kolter2012,
abstract = {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states. Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima. In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a "robust" mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time. Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice. The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.},

abstract = {Smart meter deployments are spurring renewed interest in analysis techniques for electricity usage data. An important prerequisite for data analysis is characterizing and modeling how electrical loads use power. While prior work has made significant progress in deriving insights from electricity data, one issue that limits accuracy is the use of general and often simplistic load models. Prior models often associate a fixed power level with an “on” state and either no power, or some minimal amount, with an “off” state. This paper's goal is to develop a new methodology for modeling electric loads that is both simple and accurate. Our approach is empirical in nature: we monitor a wide variety of common loads to distill a small number of common usage characteristics, which we leverage to construct accurate load-specific models. We show that our models are significantly more accurate than binary on-off models, decreasing the root mean square error by as much as 8X for representative loads. Finally, we demonstrate two example uses of our models in data analysis: i) generating device-accurate synthetic traces of building electricity usage, and ii) filtering out loads that generate rapid and random power variations in building electricity data},

abstract = {Between 2014 and 2019 more than 50 million new ‘smart meters' will be rolled out to 30
million homes and smaller businesses in Britain. These smart meters, with in-home-displays,
are intended to allow consumers to see and adjust in real time what energy they are using.
Ofgem considers that smart metering could “transform how energy markets operate”. The
Government estimates that over the next 20 years, the rollout of smart meters will deliver
over {\pounds}7 billion net benefits to consumers, energy suppliers and networks.
Since an original July 2010 Prospectus a large range of documentation has been issued by
DECC and Ofgem on the rollout programme, most recently an April 2012 update, along with
a new range of consultation documents and government responses to issues raised.
Issues of concern include the extent to which smart meters will be mandated, consumer
protection during the installation process, and concerns about privacy and access to smart
metering data. It has been decided for example that suppliers' codes of practice should ban
verbal marketing activity without prior consent during installations, with a complete ban on
completing any sales. It is proposed that in general, energy suppliers should be able to
access consumption data on a monthly basis, with a clear consumer opt-out for daily access
and an opt-in for more frequent access.
The National Audit Office (NAO) and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) have raised
concerns about the ambition of the programme, its risks and the extent of the potential
benefits to consumers. The PAC considers the challenges associated with roll-out ‘huge'.},

abstract = {A load signature is an electrical expression that a load device or appliance distinctly possesses. Load signatures can be applied to produce many useful services and products, such as, determining the energy usage of individual appliances, monitoring the health of critical equipment, monitoring power quality, and developing facility management tools. Load signatures of typical yet extensive loads are needed to be collected before applying them to different services and products. As there are an enormous number of electrical appliances, it is beneficial to classify the appliances for building a well-organized load signature database. The objective of this study is to develop an effective method to classify the loads. A 2-dimensional form of load signatures, voltage-current (V-l) trajectory, is suggested for characterizing the typical household appliances.Hierarchical clustering method was employed to classify the appliances and construct the taxonomy of the appliances. The taxonomy based on V-l trajectory was compared to the taxonomies based on traditional power metrics and eigenvectors in the previous studies. It was found that the groups of appliances in the taxonomy based on V-I trajectory were well-separated and had engineering meanings .},

The authors propose a formal description of the FSM and its output, using a regular phrase-structured grammar. This description is associated with a cost measuring its information content. The authors then state the inference problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with an objective function define as the cost of the description of the FSM and its output. A heuristic algorithm is proposed which processes the output “on line” and yields a local minimum of the authors' criterion. At each step (i.e. as new data is observed and processed), the procedure searches locally through the space of non-probabilistic FSMs, i.e., the transitions are initially regarded as being only present or absent. When a non-probabilistic model has been generated, the transition probabilities are determined from their relative frequencies given the behavior indicated by the data. This yields maximum likelihood estimates of the probabilities. The costs of the obtained probabilistic FSMs are then computed, and the K minimum cost FSMs are kept as starting points for the next step search. At each step, the generation of the FSMs is done via a local search through the neighborhoods of the K best FSMs obtained at the previous step. This algorithm is compared with similar algorithms proposed previously, and tested on a range of examples. It is found to work for a wider range of FSMs than the previous methods, and it is much more practical for large problems than previously proposed exhaustive search techniques},

We then apply the method to hourly whole-house (smart meter) data from 327 households in Ontario. The roll-out of smart (advanced) metering infrastructure in many countries will make hourly whole-house data abundant, and we propose that this method could be widely applied by utilities to target their demand-side management programs towards households more likely to provide benefits, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of such programs.},

Such automated, noninvasive device identification will be critical in future power-quality monitoring and enhancement systems. Several NN-based classification models including multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) network, and support vector machines (SVM) with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels were developed for signature extraction and device identification. These models were trained and tested using spike train data gathered from the Fourier analysis of the input current waveform in the presence of multiple devices. The performance of these models was compared in terms of their accuracy, generalization ability, and noise tolerance limits. The results showed that MLPs and SVM were both able to determine the presence of devices based on their harmonic signatures with high accuracy. MLP was found to be the best signature identification method because of its low computational requirements and ability to extract the information necessary for highly accurate device identification.},

abstract = {The method presented in this paper shows a promising potential for application in residential buildings. The results prove that the whole-house electricity consumption can be disaggregated into its major end-uses, using a pattern recognition approach and only one sensor installed on the main electric entrance of the house. It also required a one-time submetering of the target appliances during the training period, of about a week, to find the electric characteristics of appliances. The results are provided in terms of daily load profiles, energy consumption and energy contribution of selected appliances. The proposed method was tested with monitored data from 3 weeks: (i) the training period of 1 week in October, (ii) the near-to-date testing period of 1 week in November and (iii) the far-to-date testing period of 1 week in January. For instance, the difference between monitored and estimated contribution is, for the month of October 1996, as follows: (i) 13 kW h or {\$}0.85 for the DHW heater and (ii) 6 kW h or {\$}0.36 for the refrigerator. The overall difference for both appliances does not exceed {\$}1.25 for the month of October, for a total electricity bill of 912 kW h and {\$}60.60, which appears to be acceptable for every homeowner. The errors in evaluating the daily energy consumption is between −10.5{\%} and 15.9{\%} for both the DWH heater and the refrigerator.},

abstract = {Electrical load disaggregation for end-use recognition in the smart home has become an area of study of its own right. The most well-known examples are energy monitoring, health care applications, in-home activity modeling, and home automation. Real-time energy-use analysis for whole-home approaches needs to understand where and when the electrical loads are spent. Studies have shown that individual loads can be detected (and disaggregated) from sampling the power at one single point (e.g. the electric service entrance for the house) using a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approach. In this paper, we focus on the feature extraction and pattern recognition tasks for non-intrusive residential electrical consumption traces. In particular, we develop an algorithm capable of determining the step-changes in signals that occur whenever a device is turned on or off, and which allows for the definition of a unique signature (ID) for each device. This algorithm makes use of features extracted from active and reactive powers and power factor. The classification task is carried out by Support Vector Machines and 5-Nearest Neighbors methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed signature for distinguishing the different loads.},

This is in contrast to intrusive monitoring where end use devices are sensed. Building on techniques of previous works, it will be shown that NILM can be implemented on currently available commercial devices and provide meaningful feedback both to the user and supplying utility. Limitations of inexpensive commercial devices such as resolution and measurement accuracy are a challenge. An algorithm currently under development, specifically developed for the low resolution of inexpensive commercial sensor packages, will be discussed and demonstrated. This information can then be used to verify the effectiveness of various smart grid initiatives in addition to other energy saving protocols such as weather proofing and energy efficient appliances. In addition, this information can be used to select devices for distributed control by analyzing not only the type of device but also the real world operating characteristics.},

abstract = {Sensing, monitoring and actuating systems are expected to play a key role in reducing buildings overall energy consumption. Leveraging sensor systems to support energy efficiency in buildings poses novel research challenges in monitoring space usage, controlling devices, interfacing with smart energy meters and communicating with the energy grid. In the attempt of reducing electricity consumption in buildings, identifying individual sources of energy consumption is key to generate energy awareness and improve efficiency of available energy resources usage. Previous work studied several non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to classify appliances; however, the literature lacks of an comprehensive system that can be easily installed in existing buildings to empower users profiling, benchmarking and recognizing loads in real-time. This has been a major reason holding back the practice adoption of load monitoring techniques. In this paper we present RECAP: RECognition of electrical Appliances and Profiling in real-time. RECAP uses a single wireless energy monitoring sensor easily clipped to the main electrical unit. The energy monitoring unit transmits energy data wirelessly to a local machine for data processing and storage. The RECAP system consists of three parts: (1) Guiding the user for profiling electrical appliances within premises and generating a database of unique appliance signatures; (2) Using those signatures to train an artificial neural network that is then employed to recognize appliance activities (3) Providing a Load descriptor to allow peer appliance benchmarking. RECAP addresses the need of an integrated and intuitive tool to empower building owners with energy awareness. Enabling real-time appliance recognition is a stepping-stone towards reducing energy consumption and allowing a number of major applications including load-shifting techniques, energy expenditure breakdown per appliance, detection of power hungry and faulty appliances, and recogn- - ition of occupant activity. This paper describes the system design and performance evaluation in domestic environment.},

abstract = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technique that determines the electrical load composition of a household through a single point of measurement at the main power feed. In contrast with the majority of the existing approaches to solve this problem which require training, here we explore an unsupervised approach to determine the number of appliances in the household, their power consumption and state, at any given moment. We attempt to achieve this without using any a priori information on the number and type of appliances. Our approach is to first create clusters of steady-state changes and then employ a matching pursuit algorithm to reconstruct the original power signals using the clusters that were found as the sources in a linear blind source separation strategy. Changes in steady-state, sometimes referred to as events, are characterized by their change in real and reactive power (P and Q). Ultimately, the results may be applied to other features in an attempt to improve the separation between clusters. The preliminary results point toward a mixed scenario: large appliances (roughly above 400W) were easily identified, but the small appliances typically clustered together and were difficult to separate. We conclude that the errors occur during clustering which indicates that, in order to increase the purity of the clusters, perhaps other features could be used.},

Referred to as the Hawthorne effect, this inconsistently observed phenomenon can both provide insight into individuals' behavior and confound the interpretation of experimental manipulations. Here, we pursue both topics in examining how the Hawthorne effect emerges in a large field experiment focused on residential consumers' electricity use. These consumers received five postcards notifying, and then reminding, them of their participation in a study of household electricity use. We found evidence for a Hawthorne (study participation) effect, seen in a reduction of their electricity use--even though they received no information, instruction, or incentives to change. Responses to a follow-up survey suggested that the effect reflected heightened awareness of energy consumption. Consistent with that interpretation, the treatment effect vanished when the intervention ended.},

The Viterbi algorithm is modified to correct insertions and deletions as well as errors, still using a trellis diagram that has the same number of states as the FSM that generates the uncorrupted data. Two problems are examined. In the first problem the data is given in the traditional form of a string so the novel aspect is that insertions and deletions are now corrected. In the second problem, a unique string need not be given, but a regular language is given, and any string belonging to the regular language is a possible data string. Again, deletion addition, and changes of symbols are corrected. A direct generalization of the Viterbi decoding algorithm is thus proved to be an efficient technique for solving a much wider class of problems},

Our multidisciplinary research is being undertaken in a set of nominally identical townhouses in Twin Rivers, New Jersey, a recently built community of standard construction with gas space heating, electric central air conditioning, and a full set of appliances. Average levels of energy consumption and their dependence on weather and building type have been established, thereby permitting detailed quantitative studies of the sources of remaining variability. Starting from this baseline, we have established the level of change in energy consumption that followed the "energy crisis" in the autumn of 1973 and we have performed two kinds of controlled experiments: (1) experiments where a set of modifications (retrofits) are made to the building structure, and (2) experiments where "feedback" is provided to residents, on a regular basis, reporting their level of consumption of energy. Conclusions drawn from our modeling and experimentation are presented here, with emphasis given to those results bearing directly on the character of programs to retrofit the national housing stock. Photographs of the site, of building defects, and of our retrofits are included, as well as a selection of graphical displays of data, each a snapshot of a kind of analysis we have found useful and are prepared to recommend to others who wish to help develop an understanding of how houses work. Lists are included both of the program's reports and publications and of the people who have contributed to the Twin Rivers program since its inception.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new nonintrusive appliance load monitoring technique based on the integer programming. Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring is a problem to identify the operating conditions of the electric appliances in a house only by observing the overall load current and voltage. Since the overall load current is expressed as a superposition of each current of the operating appliance, the monitoring problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem by expressing the operating conditions as integer variables. This problem is solvable with sufficiently small computational burden thanks to the recent development of the commercial software. The proposed method does not require the relearning even when a new appliance is installed in the house. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is applicable to cases that some appliance has multiple modes, and cases that some same-type appliances operate simultaneously. Usefulness of the proposed technique is verified through some experimental results.},

Hourly load data, hourly load-temperature regression coefficients and simulation end-use results comprise the algorithm input. The algorithm produces hourly load profiles for air conditioning, lighting, fans and pumps, and miscellaneous loads. Measured data from two end-use metered buildings (an office and a retail store) have been used to validate the algorithm. For the retail store, the algorithm estimates of hourly end use compare remarkably well with the monitored end-use data (average error of less than 5{\%} during daytime operation). For the office building, the algorithm gives a consistent bias of about 12 and 27{\%} in overestimating the HVAC and lighting electric loads, respectively, at the expense of underestimating the miscellaenous load by 35{\%}. Results may be attributed to the presence of inconsistencies between office audit information and measured end-use data. A three-fold difference between the auditor's estimate for miscellaneous energy use and the metered amount has been found. The validation, however, indicates great promise for application of the algorithm to whole-building load data for obtaining reliable end-use data.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the concepts, methods, and procedures that psychologists and other social scientists have used to develop and field test solutions to a range of social and behavioral problems. Despite only minimal interest at this time by the federal government in behavioral approaches to energy conservation, there are now many reports demonstrating the application of psychologically based procedures to conserve energy in buildings. Methods that reward energy conservation in a number of ways have yielded meaningful short-run reductions. Extensions of current strategies and other procedures derived from a framework presented in the paper may eventually result in more pervasive, longer-term savings. In the light of that objective, the paper also outlines a number of micro- and macro-level projects, some involving the meshing of behavioral and physical technology, that can be readily conducted in residential and commercial buildings.},

abstract = {Modelling power systems is an area of ongoing interest in the transmission management and control systems community. Continuing development is driven by two forces. The traditional tasks of model maintenance and management must be achieved with fewer resources. At the same time, model exchange and coordination has become a priority. The latter force arises from the disaggregation of utility functions and the introduction of power markets. This paper begins by identifying some of the power system modelling tasks that have become important, but are ill served by current tools and techniques. Among these are model versioning and version control, migration of models between, different schema, the transformation of models for different purposes or applications, and the merging of models from different sources. These tasks are typically handled by semi-manual methods or heavily customized software. The paper then describes the application of knowledge representation to power system modelling. In particular, the power of this approach to provide generic solutions to the, foregoing problems is explored. Knowledge representation is contrasted with more common data representations and put into context with current industry initiatives, EPRI CIM (common information model), UMS DAF (data access facility) and XML/CIM. Finally, the feasibility of using knowledge representation for power system models is illustrated with a case study from a major Australian distribution utility},

abstract = {Consumers use simplified measurements as a basis for residential energy decisions. We analyze their measurements of monthly consumption, changes through time, comparison of appliances, and length of payback period. Because of systematic errors in quantification, consumers choose ineffective energy conservation actions, and underestimate the benefits of previous actions. These errors do not result solely from lack of information since they are made even by consumers who understand technical energymeasurement. To explain the persistence of a seemingly disadvantageous system, we show that consumer methods are cognitively efficient. They are easy to learn and use and are compatible with general-purpose budgeting tasks. However, they lead to higher energy use than would be economically optimal for either the individual or the nation.},

abstract = {Energy disaggregation, also known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), is the task of separating aggregate energy data for a whole building into the energy data for individual appliances. Studies have shown that simply providing disaggregated data to the consumer improves energy consumption behavior. However, placing individual sensors on every device in a home is not presently a practical solution. Disaggregation provides a feasible method for providing energy usage behavior data to the consumer which utilizes currently existing infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel framework to perform the energy disaggregation task. We model each individual device as a single-input, single-output system, where the output is the power consumed by the device and the input is the device usage. In this framework, the task of disaggregation translates into finding inputs for each device that generates our observed power consumption. We describe an implementation of this framework, and show its results on simulated data as well as data from a small-scale experiment.},

@inproceedings{Yu-HsiuLin2011,
abstract = {Due to the global warming and climate changes, using and conserving of the electrical energy effectively becomes a very important issue recently. If each appliance operates efficiently, the power energy can be used and conserved effectively. Further, the greenhouse gases can also gradually be reduced. This paper* proposes a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system that employs a decision mechanism based on hierarchical support vector machines (HSVM) to identify the energizing and de-energizing statuses of each load. In the proposed system, the load energizing and de-energizing transient features are extracted from load current waveforms that are acquired at the power entering point. The HSVM performs load identification tasks based on the features. Although a support vector machine (SVM) identifier can solve nonlinear separable cases and optimize the decision hyper-plane, it is a two-class identifier. On the other hand, the NILM problem is a multi-class identification problem. Since any multi-class identification problem can be decomposed into a series of two-class identification sub-problems, the proposed system applies a group of binary SVMs that are arranged into a form of hierarchical tree to identify the operation status of each load. Each node within the tree represents a binary SVM identifier, and each identifier is assigned to solve a corresponding two-class sub-problem. Through this hierarchical decision process, the class of an undetermined datum can be identified. Finally, the results in different experiment environments show that the proposed system is able to identify the operation status of each load, and it also has appropriate robustness.},
